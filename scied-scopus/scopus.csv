In educational settings, teachers and students use conceptual metaphors subconsciously to express their ideas about what energy is or how it functions in particular scenarios. However, research on scientific analogies and metaphors has predominantly focused on explicit instructional analogies, rather than implicit, everyday metaphor. In professional development for secondary science teachers, we sought to make explicit the embeddedness and ubiquity of conceptual metaphor in everyday language and in science—particularly, in energy—to expand teachers’ understanding of their students’ ideas. In our microcase study, we observed and video recorded four secondary teachers discussing metaphor. We used interaction analysis methods, focusing on how both discursive and nonverbal interactions between people, objects, and environment change over time, to analyze the collected data. We found evidence of teachers’ (1) learning about conceptual metaphor theory and (2) finding value in understanding conceptual metaphor in educational settings. In particular, teachers acknowledged that if they identify implicit metaphors in students’ science language, they will better understand students’ ideas about energy. We present possible mechanisms for teacher learning about and valuing of energy metaphor; we also suggest how to support teachers in noticing and valuing metaphors for energy instruction. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","conceptual metaphor; energy; secondary science teachers",,,,,,"Daane, A.R.; Department of Physics, South Seattle CollegeUnited States; email: abigail.daane@seattlecolleges.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Building on this relationship between writing and knowledge construction, writing-to-learn (WTL) activities have shown to be effective in many science classrooms, but have not been widely implemented at the postsecondary level. To address the lack of implementation, we investigated potential adopters of this pedagogy. Potential adopters, postsecondary faculty, are unique given the key role writing plays in their professional practice as researchers. Because of this unique feature and the fact that an instructor's theoretical orientation toward a construct impacts their instruction of that construct, an investigation of postsecondary faculty's conceptions of writing instruction is necessary to understand the way writing is being used in the postsecondary classroom. To this end, 33 STEM faculty across multiple disciplines and positions were interviewed about writing and its role in their classes. A phenomenographic analysis resulted in four faculty “types” consisting of unique combinations of concept and practice, organized according to compatibility with WTL. Profiles were built that describe unique conceptions, desired outcomes, and challenges for each type. These profiles provide an understanding of the relationship between faculty's conceptions and instructional practices regarding writing and lay the groundwork for understanding how writing is used in the postsecondary classroom. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","case study; faculty conceptions; phenomenography; science writing; undergraduate STEM; writing-to-learn",,,,,,"Shultz, G.V.; Department of Chemistry, University of MichiganUnited States; email: gshultz@umich.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

To advance our understanding of engineering-related identity negotiation within informal STEM education contexts, we conducted an in-depth, qualitative investigation of six adolescent girls participating in an afterschool engineering education program jointly run by two community-based organizations and a science center. Building on the Identity-Frame Model developed through our prior work, analysis of videotaped program sessions and secondary data from participants, program facilitators, and parents highlighted the important role that leadership-oriented youth played in shaping the identity negotiation of participants during the programs, both in the ways they recognized and positioned the situated identities of other youth and through their influence on the activity frames that defined the nature of the engineering activities.

Issues related to the nature of students’ representational competence, such as how they demonstrate representational competence across different domains of science, require investigation. In the present study, four aspects of representational competence across two domains of science were investigated: use of dynamic representations, use of multiple representations, use of adequate science concepts, and use of visualization strategies. Two instruments, the representational competence of states of matter and the representational competence of carbon cycling assessments were delivered via a computer-based drawing tool and were used to measure 40 senior high school students’ representational competence for the topic of states of matter and carbon cycling. The results indicated that the representational competence demonstrated in one topic was not significantly correlated to that demonstrated in the other. The results of path analyses using multiple regressions indicated a trend that the extent to which multiple representations were employed was significantly and closely related to the extent to which appropriate science concepts were applied to make the drawings. Implications of the findings are discussed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","drawing technology; path analysis using multiple regressions; representational competence",,,,,,"Chang, H.-Y.; Graduate Institute of Digital Learning and Education, National Taiwan University of Science and TechnologyTaiwan; email: hychang@mail.ntust.edu.tw",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Few studies have focused on gender concordance between mentors and mentees within the context of summer undergraduate research programs, and none have linked gender concordance with student gains. Previous research has more often overlooked the faculty–postgraduate–undergraduate triad, focusing instead on the faculty–undergrad dyad. This study explores the effects of gender concordance among mentoring dyads and triads on student gains from summer research experiences. Using programmatic and evaluation data, bivariate analyses were conducted and generalized estimating equations were employed to examine effects of gender concordance in mentoring relationships on student gains. Results indicate that gender concordance within undergraduate mentee and faculty mentor dyads promoted the greatest student gains among the six categories of mentoring relationships studied, having postgraduate mentors for undergraduates suppressed student gains, and women benefited more than men from gender concordance in mentoring relationships. Considering the results, undergraduate research program staff should make efforts to recruit more women faculty mentors, consider matching them with women undergraduates, train men scientists so they can be effective mentors for women students, and provide high-quality mentoring training opportunities for postgraduate mentors. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","gender; mentoring; undergraduate research experiences",,,,,,"Morales, D.X.; Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Texas at El PasoUnited States; email: xdeng2@utep.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Interaction ritual analysis of the focal student's interactions with peers during small-group science investigations at the microlevel (tenths of a second) and in real-time revealed that positive interaction rituals failed to form at first. Over a period of 6 months, his persistent use of nonverbal and verbal participation strategies, and opportunities to engage diverse communicative resources, resulted in higher levels of synchrony with his classmates and successful interactions in the language of instruction. The findings present novel information about the nuances of the silent, embodied participation of language learners in inquiry-oriented instruction. Further, the findings elaborate the claim that inquiry-based science pedagogies created space for students to form successful interaction rituals that, in turn, supported the focal student's science engagement and language development. © 2018 The Authors Science Education Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","inquiry-based science instruction; interaction rituals; language learners; multilingual; plurilingual; student participation",,,,,,"Siry, C.; Institute of Applied Educational Sciences, University of LuxembourgLuxembourg; email: christina.siry@uni.lu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This paper problematizes and explores the conceptualizations of these tensions by considering personal relevance, disciplinary authenticity, and common school science as three perspectives that entail different educational goals. Based on an analysis of the literature, we identify five facets of the tensions: content fidelity, content coverage, language and discursive norms, epistemic structure and standards, and significance. We then explore the manifestations of these facets in two different examples of the instruction and learning of physics at the advanced high school level in Israel and Italy. Our analysis suggests that (1) the manifestations of these tensions and their resolution are highly contextual. (2) While maintaining personal relevance and disciplinary authenticity requires some negotiation, the main tension that needs to be resolved is between personal relevance and common school science. (3) Disciplinary authenticity, when considered in terms of its full depth and scope, can be equipped to resolve this tension within the discipline. (4) To achieve resolution, teachers’ expertise should include not only pedagogical expertise but also a deep and broad disciplinary understanding. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","authenticity; engagement; high school; physics education; relevance",,,,,,"Kapon, S.; Faculty of Education in Science and Technology, Technion—Israel Institute of Technology, Technion CityIsrael; email: skapon@technion.ac.il",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This tension may arise from conflicting approaches (conceptual and/or epistemological) and/or from conflict emerging in the social relations among group members. Drawing on video records of undergraduate students working collaboratively, we use three cases to illustrate the multifaceted ways in which conflict arises—combining conceptual, epistemological, and socioemotional dynamics—and a specific way of managing the tension that can emerge from the multifaceted conflict, “taking an escape hatch.” An escape hatch is a set of discourse moves through which participants close the conversational topic, thereby relieving tension, but before a conceptual resolution is achieved. We describe how epistemological twists and turns can be recruited as a means of managing the strong emotions experienced by the students, showing the coupling of emotion and epistemology in students’ conceptual sense making during group work. We help to provide the groundwork necessary for instructors to notice, understand, and respond to one way in which conceptual–epistemological–social–emotional aspects of interaction are coupled in the emergence of tension, rather than narrowly targeting instructional moves based on only conceptual or epistemological considerations. Instead, instructors should often respond to—and help students become aware of—the emotional component of peer interactions and its entanglement with the “cold cognitive” conceptual and epistemological components. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","interaction analysis; physics; tension management",,,,,,"Sohr, E.R.; Department of Physics, University of MarylandUnited States; email: esohr@umd.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Although inquiry's underlying principles can motivate students to learn, the challenges that students encounter may hamper their motivation. Thus, the teacher's role in providing motivational support is crucial. This research examines how the interplay among the inquiry's characteristics, the challenges encountered by students, and the motivational support provided by the teacher affects students' expression of motivation throughout an online inquiry process. The messages of both the teacher and the students were examined using self-determination theory (SDT). The results indicate that the students did not automatically embrace the autonomous characteristic of open inquiry. Their expressions of motivation were dynamic, affected by the challenges that they encountered. In contrast, the teacher maintained high levels of autonomy and competence and intertwined these components in a strategy that we term guided autonomy. The teacher and students expressed high-order expressions of affect. In addition, we found a positive correlation between the teacher's motivational support and the students' expressions of motivation.

What counts as “rigorous” research? What forms of research are explicitly and implicitly supported and accepted by journal review boards, international science education organizations, faculty hiring committees, funding agencies, and so forth? How might larger institutions of power influence both the processes and the end goals of research and in what ways might they also foster social justice-centered goals? For instance, Carter's (2005) critique of science education reform documents how curriculum standards have been influenced by globalization, as a system of power, in ways that are often limiting and regressive. (In)equality also materializes in the complicated and often messy social relations between and among researchers and participants. As academics, power and privilege are certainly at play when we conduct research within school settings, where a distinct hierarchy from administrators to teachers to students dominates most school structures. Power differentials in school research settings are further entangled within each individual's (researcher, student, teacher, administrator) social/political positionalities (i.e., race, gender/gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, language, country of origin, class) and are negotiated and performed through interpersonal interactions.

However, when students are not taught how to think about modeling, and how to develop and use models, the learning potential of modeling may be limited. This paper argues that the use and explicit teaching of metacognitive tools like interactive questioning and individual reflection increase students’ ability to use and make sense of models. We present a sequence of activities incorporating metacognitive tools with a variety of models (mental, physical, simulated, and mathematical) in a high school physics unit of electricity. Using data from classroom observations, individual student reflections, group-created posters, and classroom discussion, we found evidence to demonstrate the complicated nature of conceptual change, the importance of using a variety of different representations (models) of a phenomenon, and the critical role of the teacher in learning. Teachers need to be aware of this process and able to give students the time they need to fully explore and develop multiple models and support to think critically about models.

The empirical data are 96 small-group discussions about two fundamental dilemmas: whether light can be both waves and particles, and whether the cat in Schrödinger's thought experiment can be considered to be both dead and alive. The discussions were analyzed by means of a framework of four categories, grouped as productive and nonproductive for learning, where “productive” means that students build constructively on each other's utterances and take the peers’ ideas into account. Results show that a total of 70% of the discussions were productive, indicating that small-group discussions have a potential for enhancing understanding in quantum physics. This potential is constituted by leading students to (i) articulate conceptual difficulties, (ii) deepen their understanding through exchange of views, and (iii) formulate new questions.

The study employed logistic regression modeling with propensity weighting to address differences in group characteristics to model the impact of programs. Results showed that students who participated in a program had 1.4 times the odds of wanting to pursue a STEM career, controlling for background characteristics. A closer look at program design revealed that students experiencing the real-world relevance of STEM had 1.8 times the odds of aspiring to STEM careers at the end of high school compared with controls.

Instead, scientific knowledge is presented as certain and students have limited opportunities to use their own judgment in the laboratory. A consequence of this may be that students approach science with a moral absolutist mindset, believing that science is about learning facts and scientists have little need to exercise ethical judgments in relation to data. Students may also hold different ethical standards for themselves and professional scientists. We draw on data from a first-year science module to show that these views can be challenged by encouraging students to reflect on their own behavior and that of famous scientists in situations with varying degrees of professional ethical ambiguity. We provide evidence of significant transitions in students’ thinking, suggesting that reflection on these issues may lead to substantial epistemological and ethical development. By the end of the module, many students had moved from an initial position of certainty to the acceptance of multiple viewpoints or to a more mature understanding of the evidence-based nature of science, as well as gaining the ability to critique decisions and make ethical judgments. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","epistemological development; judgment; scientific data; scientific ethics",,,,,,"Howitt, S.M.; Research School of Biology, Australian National UniversityAustralia; email: Susan.howitt@anu.edu.au",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

A key focus in recent reform efforts is the inclusion of science practices, which are potentially a significant challenge for schools. Consequently, we investigated K–8 principals’ views of good science instruction and their abilities to analyze classroom videos in relation to the science practices. Our research suggests that K–8 principals have limited understandings. Principals often described good science instruction as including the investigating practices, but rarely included the sensemaking or critiquing science practices. They also frequently discussed good science instruction as being hands-on, but had different meanings of what counted as hands-on. When evaluating videos, all of the principals focused on general pedagogy with few principals focused on the science practices and limited understandings of the quality of the science practices. If we want to support systemic change, we need to develop the capacity of principals to effectively supervise science that reflects recent reform efforts. However, principals need a vision that aligns with the science practices, but do not require (or have the time to obtain) the same level of expertise as their science teachers. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","instructional leadership; principals; science practices",,"BC, Boston College; DRL-1415541, NSF, National Science Foundation","This research was conducted as part of the Instructional Leadership for Scientific Practices: Resources for Principals in Evaluating and Supporting Teachers’ Science Instruction project, supported in part by the National Science Foundation grant DRL-1415541.

This study examines how U.S. high school textbooks and supplemental curricular materials published between 2007 and 2012 portray the causes, consequences, and potential responses to GCC. Our data included text segments related to these topics in five science textbooks, four social studies textbooks, and eight sets of GCC supplemental materials. To analyze these text segments, we conducted several rounds of coding, first categorizing curricula by their acceptance of the human causes of GCC and then coding relevant text segments on several dimensions related to the consequences of and potential responses to GCC. Findings indicate that (1) about half the curricula portray human activity as a major cause of current climate change, (2) most curricula include information about climatic changes but few details about potentially proximal, near-term impacts of GCC, and (3) most curricula offer a narrow set of strategies for responding to GCC. These findings suggest that educators should critically examine curricular materials they use to teach about GCC and that scholars should continually examine how GCC is portrayed to youth. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","climate change; curriculum; global warming; textbooks",,,,,,"Levy, B.L.M.; Department of Educational Theory and Practice, University at Albany, State University of New YorkUnited States; email: bllevy@albany.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In this paper we present the development of the Dimensions of Success (DoS) tool, which defines twelve key components of informal, exploratory STEM programming that goes beyond the school day. Additionally, we present a validity argument that includes reliability evidence for the DoS tool based on two studies: Study 1 (n = 284 observations) and Study 2 (n = 56 observations). Our findings suggest that the coherence of the constructs and validity evidence, as well as the training and certification procedures in place for DoS, make it an important tool to understand the quality of STEM experiences for youth beyond the school day.

Given young children's interest in dinosaurs and other fossils, fossil investigations can provide a rich entry into evolutionary biology for young learners. Educational psychology literature has addressed children's reasoning about foundational concepts related to fossils such as living/nonliving distinctions, causation, origins of objects, and conceptions of time. This exploratory qualitative case study explored preschool children's ideas about fossils and these foundational concepts as children moved through a 1-week science camp devoted to fossils. Research participants consisted of 15 preschool children aged 3–6 enrolled in a university-affiliated summer camp. Data sources included daily assessments and postcamp individual interviews. Data analysis yielded several main findings. Children were successful at determining where fossils could be found, identifying familiar fossils and fossil tracks, ascertaining that familiar and unfamiliar fossils were nonliving, and determining that rocks have natural origins. Children struggled more often at understanding how fossils differ from recent bones and skulls, properties uniting fossils, and the natural origins of plants and unfamiliar fossils. We also noted clear age- and object-related trends for living/nonliving distinctions, teleological reasoning, origins, and object ages.

However, relatively little evidence is available about what features of curriculum materials really matter to impact student and teacher learning. To address this need, the current study examined curriculum features associated with student and teacher outcomes. We reviewed sample curriculum materials and documentation reporting on the instructional outcomes of 51 research-based K–12 science curriculum materials. Our findings reveal that teacher supports, rather than student supports, had positive impacts on both student and teacher outcomes. Specifically, positive student outcomes were associated with curriculum materials with a larger scope and with materials that provide teachers with information about students’ ideas and recommended instructional strategies. Positive teacher outcomes were associated with the presence of information about targeted standards and recommended instructional strategies. Relatively fewer studies reported on teacher outcomes, and evidence about other dimensions of curriculum materials impact (e.g., spread, sustainability) was difficult to find.

Underlying this position is the idea that this framework allows promoting, in a unified manner, facility with the scientific practice of constructing explanations, appreciation of its epistemic underpinnings and understanding of its outcome (i.e., conceptual understanding). The effective enactment of this framework in the classroom needs to be guided by a theoretically sound perspective into what counts as a “good” explanation. This is currently an underdeveloped area within science education, toward which we seek to contribute by elaborating a theoretical account. This account capitalizes on three key epistemological features of explanation for the purposes of science teaching and learning, namely empirical validity, interpretive power, and generalizability. Drawing on these features, we then set out to identify certain epistemological orientations, which could be usefully promoted among the students to support productive engagement with the pursuit of a “better” explanation. The ideas addressed in this article could serve to inform attempts to develop teaching innovations centered on the notion of explanation but also educational materials for teacher professional education and development. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","epistemological understanding; scientific explanation",,,,,,"Papadouris, N.; Learning in Science Group, Department of Educational Sciences, University of CyprusCyprus; email: npapa@ucy.ac.cy",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Using the tenets of ambitious teaching, we explore how Grade 4 teachers utilized elements of high-leverage practices in an effort to teach science using engineering design. Data included 33 hours of classroom observations, semistructured interviews, and teacher reflections. Using lesson event, classroom organization, and instructional codes analogous to the literature on the engineering design process, we generated and analyzed classroom event maps, noting trends across multiple and individual teacher classrooms. Results indicated percentages of time spent on different phases within the design process among multiple classrooms as well as consistency across individual cases that demonstrate teachers’ capacity to enact ambitious teaching practices through engineering design-based science instruction.

It is of paramount importance to ensure that students have a relevant repertoire of practices they can employ when facing scientific content inside and outside the school context. The present study reports on students in seventh grade acting as researchers. Over an 8-week collaborative research period, students posed their own research question, attempted to answer it by systematically testing hypotheses, discussing findings, presenting their conclusions, and documenting their process in a written report. Drawing on the perspectives of New Literacy Studies—which sees literacy as socially situated—we analyze the purpose of all the 21 participating students’ texts (n = 344). Video observations and interviews with students are used to contextualize the writing events. We find that the students chose to write multiple kinds of texts for a variety of purposes. Analyzing purpose and the context, three stages of socialization into scientific writing is revealed, ranging from what the students write on their own initiative, via texts written through challenges to demanding research tasks scaffolded through writing instructions given by the teacher. Further, the students emphasized the relevance of both the research experience and the writing to their future adult life. © 2017 The Authors Science Education Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","science literacy; students as researchers; video study; writing",,,,,,"Bjørkvold, T.; Faculty of Education and International Studies, Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied SciencesNorway; email: tuva.bjorkvold@hioa.no",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Metaphors are widely used in scientific and educational discourse to communicate ideas about abstract phenomena. However, although considered valuable teaching tools, metaphors are ambiguous and can be misleading when used in educational contexts. Educational researchers have found metaphorical patterns in scientific and everyday language that have been analyzed on the level of conceptual metaphors. However, little is known about the way students deal with crucial metaphors of specific science content. Using metaphor theory as a framework, the study presented here focuses on metaphors describing energy transfer through an ecosystem: energy flow, energy flow is not a cycle, energy flow is a one-way street, and energy loss. Applying qualitative content analysis, the usage of the metaphors was analyzed in 13 biology textbooks and 50 students’ texts. We found notable differences between textbooks’ and students’ application of metaphors. Students often do not adopt the metaphors or use them as intended. For example, energy flow is a conventionalized metaphor for energy transfer processes, but students tend to use this metaphor in terms of a substance instead of a process. Implications for the use of these metaphors in biology instruction are derived. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ecosystem; energy transfer; metaphor; secondary",,,,,,"Wernecke, U.; Department of Biology Education, Leibniz Institute for Science and Mathematics Education (IPN)Germany; email: wernecke@ipn.uni-kiel.de",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

A situational interest refers to the short-term spike in a person's attention and participation in an activity and it is triggered in the interactions between the person and environment features (e.g., novelty and surprise). As represented in the literature, extant conceptions of the phenomenon frame it fundamentally as a discontinuity in a person's experiences. Put differently, a situational interest denotes a moment in which a new object or activity is first brought into a person's stream of experiences and its triggering marks the boundary between two qualitatively distinct moments—a before-and-after—in one's ongoing activity participation. In contrast, I conjecture that situational interests are best understood as phenomena that combine both discontinuous and continuous dimensions of experience. To argue this point, I use three in-depth videotaped case studies of the triggering and (when available) retriggering of situational interests in STEM-based practices and show that the continuity + discontinuity lens provides a fine-grained and more accountable description of the phenomenon, its triggering process, and its eventual uptake and development (or not). © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","activity; continuities and discontinuities; individual interest; situational interest; socio-cultural theory",,"NSF, National Science Foundation; Spencer Foundation","I thank the editors and three anonymous reviewers for their insights, comments on, and suggestions to earlier drafts of the manuscript.

Indeed, the modern world is facing ever-more complex problems that require innovative ways of thinking about, around, and with science. As numerous educational stakeholders have suggested, such skills and abilities are not innate and must, therefore, be taught (e.g., McNeill & Krajcik, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 45(1), 53-78. 2008). However, such instruction requires a fundamental shift in science pedagogy so as to foster knowledge and practices like deep, conceptual understanding, model-based reasoning, and oral and written argumentation where scientific evidence is evaluated (National Research Council, Next Generation Science Standards: For States, by States, Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2013). The purpose of our quasi-experimental study was to examine the effectiveness of Quality Talk Science, a professional development model and intervention, in fostering changes in teachers' and students' discourse practices as well as their conceptual understanding and scientific argumentation. Findings revealed treatment teachers' and students' discourse practices better reflected critical-analytic thinking and argumentation at posttest relative to comparison classrooms. Similarly, at posttest treatment students produced stronger written scientific arguments than comparison students. Students' growth in conceptual understanding was nonsignificant. These findings suggest discourse interventions such as Quality Talk Science can improve high-school students' ability to engage in scientific argumentation. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Argumentation; Conceptual understanding; Discourse pedagogy; Quality Talk; Scientific discourse",,,,,,"Murphy, P.K.email: pkm15@psu.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Across programs, SMIs provided opportunities for PSTs to experience the instructional practices as intended, although there was less opportunity for pedagogical development around them. The strongest evidence of PST fidelity to the intervention was found for two practices: “Increasing student interaction” and “Facilitating student talk.” Considerable variation was found across the programs for other practices including some evidence of negative effects.

To explore when evolution instructors have similar religious cultures and beliefs as their students, we interviewed 32 evolution instructors at Christian universities nationwide about their practices and experiences teaching evolution. Christian university instructors emphasized teaching for acceptance of evolution while holding an inclusive teaching philosophy that they perceived led to a safe environment for students. Additionally, almost all instructors reported using practices that have been shown to increase student acceptance of evolution and reduce student conflict between evolution and religion. Further, we found that these instructors perceived that their own religious backgrounds have guided their decisions to teach evolution to their students in a culturally competent way.

The present study investigated (1) changes to plausibility judgments and knowledge as a result of a series of instructional scaffolds, called model–evidence link activities, that facilitated evaluation of scientific and alternative models in four different Earth science topics (climate change, fracking and earthquakes, wetlands and land use, and the formation of Earth’s Moon) and (2) relations between evaluation, plausibility reappraisal, and knowledge. Repeated measure multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) showed that participants’ plausibility judgments shifted toward scientifically accepted explanations and increased their knowledge about relevant Earth science topics after participating in the activities. Structural equation modeling revealed that 10% of the postinstructional knowledge scores were related to participants’ evaluations, above and beyond background knowledge, which accounted for 26% of the variance. The activities used in this study may help students develop their critical thinking skills by facilitating evaluation of the validity of explanations based on evidence, a scientific practice that is key to understanding both scientific content and science as a process.

The findings use students’ conceptual models and classroom dialogue as evidence to illustrate the roles that the CCC played in opportunities to learn. The CCCs appear to play three roles: (1) they implicitly served as a frame for the classroom activities and dialogue, (2) they explicitly framed a discussion to develop students’ understanding about their use as a lens to examine the phenomenon, and (3) the components of the CCC appeared in students’ conceptual models highlighting aspects of their understanding.

The program has focused its efforts on a group of 16 chemistry and physics teachers in Southeast high-needs schools. The conceptual framework is based on the view that teacher leaders are those individuals who retain a classroom presence, while simultaneously innovating practice and empowering others. A core principle of the framework is that embodying these attributes requires an ability to see oneself and the teaching practice in a way that goes beyond the expertise associated with content and pedagogical knowledge. Evidence drawn from years three and four of the NSF Noyce Master Teacher program are presented to demonstrate the participating teachers' understanding of the framework's components.

CCT proposes that access to large and affluent social networks containing supportive individuals who have knowledge of how to successfully navigate institutions of power is currently core to STEM doctoral success. This access reinforces STEM identity and belonging, but has been and continues to be primarily preserved for White students via an ever-evolving system of racism.

The two groups were purposefully selected because the students showed contrasting patterns of collaboration in modeling activities and sometimes showed significant shifts in their participation. We qualitatively analyzed the students' epistemological framing, positional framing, and modeling processes in each episode, based on their discourse and behaviors in the modeling practices. We found that the students’ epistemological and positional framing were dynamically intertwined with each other and worked together to guide the students’ participation in the group modeling. The students actively constructed and negotiated their perceptions about how to participate in the modeling practices, and those epistemological perceptions were closely related to how they positioned themselves and other participants in each context.

An ongoing vexation facing science teacher educators is helping future elementary teachers overcome anxiety and negative associations with science due to their own school science experiences, while simultaneously encouraging innovative and ambitious teaching practice. Utilizing wonder as a pedagogical tool for emotional and aesthetic engagement with science holds promise as an entry point to connect future teachers with meaningful science content and practice. The link between wonder and science is well-articulated by successful scientists throughout history, and yet is rarely employed explicitly within elementary or teacher education science learning contexts. Forging a pedagogy of wonder demands connection to the emotive embodiment of science as a uniquely human process that nurtures our intense need to know. This qualitative case study is an effort to better understand if utilizing pedagogy intentionally focused on wonder could impact PSETs’ perceptions of science and scientific thinking. This paper describes the key findings that emerged while utilizing pedagogy steeped in wonder with PSETs, and the degree to which engaging with wonder impacted their perceptions of science and their future science teaching.

However, learning with simulations requires supportive elements to scaffold learners’ activities. Thus, our motivation was to investigate whether direct or indirect metacognitive scaffolding (i.e., training and prompting, respectively) or a combination of both during simulation-based learning leads to better learning outcomes compared to simulation-based learning alone. Employing a 2 × 2 factorial design (N = 99 Austrian secondary school students), we explored the role of metacognitive training prior to the use of simulations and the role of metacognitive prompting during the learning phase. Four different conditions were compared in relation to knowledge about the principle of energy conservation. A pre- and posttest assessing knowledge acquisition, metacognitive behavior, cognitive load, and mental effort was applied. At first glance, the results indicate no main effects for training and prompting, and no interaction effect. A closer look at the actual use of prompting after the empirical data were obtained, however, reveals a significant impact of the metacognitive strategies employed on performance in the posttest, with higher scores in the condition where appropriate prompting was used.

One powerful contemporary model of classroom learning, the variation theory of learning, posits that the way an object of learning gets handled is another vital feature for the establishment of successful teaching practices. An important part of what lies behind the constitution of teaching practices is visual representational reasoning that is a function of disciplinary relevant aspects and educationally critical features of the aspects embedded in the intended object of learning. Little is known about teachers reasoning about such visual representational practices. This work addresses this shortfall in the area of chemical bonding. The data consist of semistructured interviews with 12 chemistry teachers in the Swedish upper secondary school system. The methodology uses a thematic analytic approach to capture and characterize the teachers’ reasoning about their classroom visual representational practices. The results suggest that the teachers’ reasoning tended to be limited. However, the teachers’ pay attention to the meaning-making potential of the approaches for showing representations. The analysis presents these visualization approaches and the discussion makes theoretical links to the variation theory of learning. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","chemical bonding; chemistry education; Swedish upper secondary school; teacher reasoning; visual representational practices",,,,,,"Patron, E.; Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Linnaeus UniversitySweden; email: emelie.patron@lnu.se",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Justice-centered science pedagogy is introduced as a theoretical framework built on the traditions of critical pedagogy and culturally relevant pedagogy to address these inequities as components of larger oppressive systems. This study examines how a justice-centered advanced chemistry class in an urban neighborhood high school supported students to succeed academically while taking up urgent issues of social and environmental justice identified by their communities. The findings include evidence that curriculum organized around an issue of environmental racism supported academic achievement that exceeded the expectations of a typical high school chemistry course. The findings also document how the curriculum provided opportunities for students to move beyond academic achievement to position themselves as transformative intellectuals. As transformative intellectuals, students demonstrated complex thinking about science and social justice issues, cultivated their commitment to their communities and cultures of origin, and developed credibility as local youth knowledgeable in science. These findings have implications for teachers, teacher educators, and educational researchers who wish to engage with science education as a catalyst for social transformation. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","critical pedagogy; culturally relevant science; equity in science education; secondary chemistry; social justice",,,,,,"Morales-Doyle, D.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, University of Illinois at ChicagoUnited States; email: moralesd@uic.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

A complexity approach represents systems as many interacting entities. The construct of micro–macro compatibility is introduced, the degree of similarity between behaviors at the micro- and macro-levels of the system. Seventh-grade students’ learning about gases was studied using questionnaires and interviews. An experimental group (n = 47) learned with a complexity curriculum that included agent-based computer models, a workbook, class discussions, and laboratory experiments. A comparison group (n = 45) learned with a normative curriculum, incorporating lectures, a textbook, class discussions, and laboratory experiments. Significant learning gains and strong effect sizes were found in the experimental group's overall learning. Diffusion, density, and kinetic molecular theory were learned better with a complexity approach. Pressure, temperature, and the gas laws were learned similarly with both approaches. Learning to notice micro-level behaviors and their probabilistic nature was greater with the complexity approach. Analysis showed that only concepts that have less “micro–macro compatibility” were learned better with a complexity approach. Thus, a complexity approach helps separate the microbehaviors and then relate them to the macrobehaviors when these behaviors are dissimilar. We discuss how micro–macro compatibility helps point to concepts whose learning would benefit strongly from a complexity approach. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","agent-based modeling; complex systems; conceptual learning; science education; systems thinking",,,,,,"Levy, S.T.; Faculty of Education, University of HaifaIsrael; email: stlevy@edu.haifa.ac.il",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Such exhibitions encourage visitors to reflect upon different sides of a story and to form or adjust their attitudes toward the topic on display. However, there is very little evidence of museum visits influencing visitors’ attitudes. Using a risk–benefit museum text, we set out to explore this blind spot of attitude change in a science museum, with visual and auditory text as information conditions. Our results show a small average change in visitors’ attitude toward the text topic after information (N = 225). No significant differences were found between participants’ attitude change in the two information conditions. We also explored whether participants’ attitude change can be predicted based on presentation modality and four dimensions of attitude strength (prior knowledge, attitudinal certainty, attitudinal importance, and attitudinal ambivalence) that are known to play a role in attitude change. Results indicate that this model explained a small part of the variance, but only ambivalence added statistically significantly to the prediction. Overall, our findings suggest that risk–benefit information can on average change visitors’ attitudes and that prior attitudinal ambivalence can influence that change. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","attitude change; attitude strength; museum visitors; risk–benefit information; science museum",,"SPP1409 - LE 1303/8-2, DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft SPP1409 - LE 1303/8-2",,,"Phelan, S.; TUM School of Education, Technical University of MunichGermany; email: sielle.phelan@tum.de",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

When supported by educative curriculum materials (ECM) and heavy investment in professional development (PD), teachers implementing a unit designed around mathematical modeling of scientific mechanisms substantially increased students’ ability to make both qualitative and quantitative predictions (Schuchardt & Schunn, 2016). Because of concerns about equitable access to support resources, we investigated whether variations in PD support while retaining ECM could differentially affect two student learning outcomes: Quantitative Predictions and Qualitative Predictions. Two contrasts were performed examining: (1) the effect of reducing PD and (2) whether eliminating PD entirely caused further harm to student learning. Reducing and eliminating PD had no significant effect on student gains in Qualitative Predictions, suggesting ECM can be sufficient for teachers to support student learning of conceptual science content. However, student gains in Quantitative Predictions decreased significantly upon reducing PD; eliminating PD did not cause significant additional decreases. Combined, these findings suggest that amount of face-to face PD support necessary to achieve student-learning gains can vary depending on whether the practice requires application of qualitative science content or quantitative reasoning. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","educative curriculum materials; mathematical modeling; Next Generation Science Standards; professional development; student learning",,,,,,"Schuchardt, A.M.; Department of Biology Teaching and Learning, University of MinnesotaUnited States; email: aschucha@umn.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Thinking about learning progressions for modeling, however, involves challenges in coordinating between aggregate arcs in the curriculum and individual student learning trajectories. First, individual student performance is often dependent on students’ epistemic aims and the nature of the conceptual and representational context. Second, approaches for longitudinally supporting students in modeling is a relatively nascent endeavor, although notable exemplars have been developed (e.g., IQWST). Third, research on the highest levels of the proposed progression is often hypothetical, because few students demonstrate high-level modeling practices in typical classrooms. In response to these challenges, we conducted a semester-long design-based study of eighth graders engaging in diagrammatic, physical, and computational modeling. In this paper, we explore conceptual and representational contexts designed to support sophisticated modeling practices and beliefs, analyze the nature of high-level performances achieved through these contexts, and suggest revisions to the articulation of the Schwarz and colleagues learning progression to increase its utility and generalizability when viewed through a resource-related lens. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","design-based research; learning progression; longitudinal analysis; modeling",,"1441542, NSF, National Science Foundation; 1119290, NSF, National Science Foundation","This study is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grants no. 1119290 and 1441542.

Data are derived from multimodal cases authored by four females from nondominant communities that present an account of “science that matters” from their work during their middle school years. We argue that consequential learning in science for these girls involves engaging science with a commitment to their community. This form of engagement required the girls to develop bridging practices that allowed them to transform existing relationships among science and community for themselves and others despite normative barriers experienced in science. Our study expands upon current understandings of consequential learning through highlighting the vital role of sociohistorically constructed understandings of community in determining when, how, and why science learning and doing matters for youth. This view opens up new ways to understand how youth can and do contribute to the changing contexts in which science takes place, and toward the ways in which youth contributions alter what gets counted as learning, as being expert, and as meaningful participation. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Community science; consequential learning; Equity; Hope; youth participatory action research",,,,,,"Birmingham, D.; Colorado State UniversityUnited States; email: Daniel.Birmingham@colostate.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

An analytic framework of figured worlds, cultural models, and identity work is employed to understand the challenges they faced. The dominant cultural models of learning that were reproduced in their science courses are explored through data drawn from lecture and laboratory observations, teacher and student interviews, and student journals. The analysis shows that the dominant teacher-centered and sink-or-swim cultural models of learning severely limited the available resources for latecomers’ identity work. The resources that were available tended to afford recognition as good students, rather than as being good at, or interested in, science. However, by improvising with the available resources, including some acquired outside of the science program, the two latecomers were sometimes able to reposition themselves in more powerful subject positions, which had far-reaching consequences for their science trajectories. We also demonstrate how using a sociocultural framework and methodological approaches that focus on student–teacher interactions yields insights into the persistence of nontraditional students that are not possible when the focus of research is solely on learning and cognitive gains. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","figured worlds; identity; non-traditional; postsecondary; trajectories",,,,,,"Jackson, P.A.; Department of Integrated Studies in Education, McGill UniversityCanada; email: phoebe.jackson@mail.mcgill.ca",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This study examines the central assumption behind these schools—that they provide students from subgroups underrepresented in STEM with experiences that equip them academically and attitudinally to enter and stay in the STEM pipeline. Hierarchical modeling was applied to data from student surveys and state longitudinal data records for 5113 students graduating from 39 ISHSs and 22 comprehensive high schools in North Carolina and Texas. Compared to peers from the same demographic group with similar Grade 8 achievement levels, underrepresented minority and female ISHS students in both states were more likely to undertake advanced STEM coursework. Hispanics in Texas and females in both states expressed more STEM career interest in Grade 12 if they attended an ISHS. Positive relationships between ISHS attendance and grade point average were found in the total sample and each subgroup in North Carolina. Positive ISHS advantages in terms of test scores for the total student sample were found for science in both states and for mathematics in Texas. For the various student subgroups, test score differences favored the ISHS samples but attained statistical significance only for African Americans’ science achievement scores in the Texas study. © 2017 The Authors.

Specifically, it proposes a learning progression that explains how scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas come together in naming and grouping, length of change over time, and the role of common ancestry in evolutionary relatedness. To develop this learning progression, we created a 3D plant evolution curriculum for urban middle school students and over two implementation cycles we measured student understanding before, during, and after use of the curriculum. We used an iterative design, grounded in evidence of student learning over time to develop and revise our learning progression framework, assessments, and curriculum. The learning progression developed through this process is a template for conceptual learning through scientific practice, the type of 3D learning advocated by the Next Generation Science Standards.

Furthermore, a high initial level of situational and individual interest was maintained in the treatment condition, whereas interest decreased in the comparison. A content analysis of journal entries suggested an association between parents showing value for science concepts and an increase in students’ perceived experiential value.

In particular, we ask what are the celebrated identity performances within science classes, how are these re/produced and/or contested, and by whom? Analyzing data from 9 months of observations of science classes with nine teachers and c. 200 students aged 11–15 from six London schools and 13 discussion groups with 59 students, we identify three dominant celebrated identity performances (“tick box” learning, behavioral compliance, and muscular intellect) and discuss the complex ways in which these are promulgated both institutionally and interpersonally by teachers and students, drawing out the implications for students’ performances of science.

In this study, we explored ninth-grade students’ discrete emotions expressed during science activities in a 9-week unit on chemistry. Individual student's emotions were analyzed through multiple data sources including classroom videos, interviews, and emotions diaries completed at the end of each lesson. Results from three representative students are presented as cases within a case study. Using a theoretical perspective drawn from theories of emotions founded in sociology, three assertions emerged. First, students experienced frustration when learning new chemistry concepts. Second, frustration was resolved through student–student and teacher–student interactions. Third, frustration was transformed when students were afforded time to revisit new concepts. Furthermore, the teacher's identification of students’ emotions enabled differentiation of learning through individualized interactions. Finally, we explain how the temporality of emotions emerged as an important phenomenon and suggest an elaboration to Turner's theorization of emotions. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"King, D.; Queensland University of Technology, Victoria Park Rd, Kelvin Grove, Australia; email: d.king@qut.edu.au",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

An aspect of teachers’ work that is understudied is how teachers manage the complexity inherent in navigating between claims and empirical data. In other words, what do teachers do when students do not see what they are “supposed to” see or when they make sense of observations in unexpected ways? We contend that such complexity is inherent to the scientific endeavor, and that engaging with it is central to doing science. Therefore, the moves that science teachers make in this context have important consequences for students’ conceptual and epistemic understandings. We apply an epistemic levels coding scheme to three classroom episodes in order to better understand the complexity of classroom evidence construction and to develop a description of strategies that teachers might enact to manage this complexity. We then discuss the implications of these strategies for how students are positioned to engage in scientific knowledge construction. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","scientific argumentation; scientific evidence; teacher talk moves",,"0628253, NSF, National Science Foundation","The authors wish to thank Catherine O'Connor and three anonymous reviewers for their feedback on early drafts of this manuscript.

Despite its prevalence in classroom talk, few have examined the role of metadiscourse and how it assists teachers and students to manage classroom communication of scientific knowledge. Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyze how science teachers use metadiscourse to construct scientific knowledge with their students. Based on a corpus of classroom video data, I developed a typology of metadiscourse commonly found in science classroom discourse. The typology comprises six major categories of metadiscourse, namely text connective, knowledge connective, activity connective, attitude marker, epistemology marker, and interpretive marker. In addition, I showed how the analysis on metadiscourse was necessary to complement the gaps from classroom analysis focusing on the interaction and content development aspects of classroom talk, particularly during the opening and reviewing stages of constructing a scientific explanation. With a better understanding of metadiscourse, its potential use as a pedagogical intervention to promote science learning is then discussed. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"OER, Office of Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health; ERIAN, Energy Research Institute, Nanyang Technological University; MOE, Ministry of Education - Singapore; NIE, National Institute of Education","This paper refers to data from the research projects ?Developing disciplinary literacy pedagogy in the sciences?

Under these circumstances, the transparency of images and models used for explaining various phenomena becomes central. The present study deals with 20 Swedish children, 9–12 years old, discussing an illustration meant to show the cause of the different appearances of the Moon in the sky. The students’ task was to place eight numbered moon phases in the lunar orbit in the image. The illustration in question was chosen (a) because it was of a kind frequently used to explain the lunar phases and (b) because the phenomenon is known to be difficult to understand for students of all ages. The analysis leans on historical and sociocultural approaches as well as on multimodal semiotics. The results show that a majority of students were able to make sense of the most central features of the illustration but that very few spontaneously reasoned in a way that could be interpreted as the intended meaning-making of the cause of the lunar phases. The results also indicate that the simultaneous adoption of two perspectives necessary for understanding the phenomenon was a stumbling block for most of the students. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"721-2009-5995, VR, Vetenskapsrådet","The research reported here was financially supported by the Swedish Research Council (grant number 721-2009-5995).",,,"Åberg-Bengtsson, L.; Department of Educational Research and Development, University of BoråsSweden; email: lisbeth.aberg-bengtsson@hb.se",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

The construct is defined by three characteristics: (1) motivated use (application of learning in “free-choice” contexts), (2) expansion of perception (seeing objects, events, or issues through the lens of the content), and (3) experiential value (valuing content for how it enriches everyday experience). To enhance conceptions of engagement in science, the current study sought to identify and describe profiles of transformative engagement by investigating levels and combinations of the three characteristics of transformative experience. In addition, it examined how learning and instruction relate to these profiles. Sixty-five middle school science students were interviewed and responses were coded for the three characteristics of transformative experience. Scores on these characteristics were used as variables in cluster analysis and representative clusters were identified. Profiles of transformative engagement were developed and described based on these clusters. Profiles representing greater transformative engagement were associated with greater learning. Relative to a comparison condition, instruction designed to foster transformative experience yielded a higher percentage of students in the profile reflecting engagement in a genuine transformative experience. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Pugh, K.J.; School of Psychological Sciences, University of Northern ColoradoUnited States; email: kevin.pugh@unco.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

It compares the processes and outcomes of several types of professional learning opportunities within a Math and Science Partnership based on how well they facilitated productive communication, student-centered instructional practices, and knowledge negotiation. It discusses conflicts as components of faculty member/teacher interactions, regardless of the setting. However, when laboratory materials provide a relevant context for collaborative learning, and when there are opportunities for the development of microlevel interactional solidarity, conflicts can lead to knowledge negotiation rather than disengagement. Furthermore, these settings can reduce faculty members’ use of lecture-based approaches, mitigate status differences, and facilitate the development of reform-minded identities. This study suggests that while a focus on mutual learning is preferable to transmission in K-20 partnerships, it is important to consider that mutual learning may be a negotiated product emerging from conflict and dialogue rather than an unproblematic exchange of information. In addition, it suggests that K-20 partnerships should intentionally create opportunities that foster the establishment of goal-oriented temporary communities, as these can support persistence through conflicts, reform-minded teaching identities, and inquiry-based instruction. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Olitsky, S.; Department of Teacher Education, Saint Joseph's University, 5600 City Avenue, United States; email: solitsky@sju.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

However, teachers need support in integrating argumentation into classroom instruction. We examined teachers’ enactments of an educative science curriculum and their curricular decision making for argumentation. Ten middle school teachers enacted lessons that focused on both the structure of an argument and argumentation as a dialogic process. For each teacher, we analyzed videotapes of two lessons and follow-up interviews. Across the teachers, we observed a wide range in teachers’ enactments. In some instances, teachers’ instructional practices aligned with the underlying epistemic goals, while in other cases the structural aspects were oversimplified and discourse norms followed more traditional teacher-led patterns. To support classroom instruction to move beyond pseudoargumentation, we found three main influences on teachers’ curricular decision making in classes with higher quality argumentation: (1) teachers’ understanding of argumentation as an epistemic practice (rather than surface level features), (2) teachers as critically reflective curriculum users, and (3) teachers problematizing their prior teaching experiences. As a field, we need to think critically about how to design teacher education experiences to discourage the relabeling of teaching with reform-oriented terms, such as argumentation, and instead support instructional transformation. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"BC, Boston College; DRL-1119584, NSF, National Science Foundation; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; UC Berkeley, University of California Berkeley","This research was conducted as part of the Constructing and Critiquing Arguments in Middle School Science Classrooms: Supporting Teachers with Multimedia Educative Curriculum Materials project, supported in part by the National Science Foundation grant DRL-1119584.

We examine the ways that these practices emerge from the work of engineering and serve to guide problem solving across a range of engineering fields. The proposed epistemic practices for education take into consideration social contexts of engineering, the salience of evidence for decision making, the types of tools and strategies used to construct knowledge, and need for creativity and innovation.

This study uses a framework of nine dimensions of effective assessment practice in science classrooms to compare more and less effective assessment practice among a purposive sample of middle school science teachers. Participating teachers collected 10 days of assessment artifacts, lesson plans, and student work for a science unit. Our comparison indicated that particular dimensions, such as setting goals, aligning assessments with goals, frequency, and variety of assessment, can be addressed relatively easily by teachers whose overall collection of artifacts were rated in the top and bottom quartile. However, dimensions that take into account the quality or depth of student learning, such as the cognitive complexity of the task, the type of feedback that is provided, or how well teachers adapt instruction based on information from assessments, differ more significantly among teachers in our sample.

This approach contrasts with more traditional school-like canonical patterns of engagement in family science conversations where adults state facts and provide explanations to children. The Anytime, Anywhere resources were designed to locate phenomena of interest in outdoor settings and cue families about how they might engage playfully in exploration by using sensemaking activities and conversation starters. We analyzed families’ video-recorded activities and interviews as they field-tested the resources at a coastal beach. The analysis shows families engaged in three features of scientific sensemaking, both in response to our designed activities and spontaneously.

The theoretical framework, coordination class theory, has primarily been used to capture individual learning in interview settings, and here it is applied to analytically capture both individual and group learning in a complex classroom environment. Classrooms of ninth-grade earth science students used the position of their bodies to model a specific scientific concept, the steady-state energy of the earth. The students encountered difficulties aligning their understanding of the scientific concept with the models. Subsequently, they changed their models in specific ways that better aligned their understanding of the scientific concept with their newly modified model. The theory is utilized to describe learning by both individuals and the group in this classroom environment and shows how a single student's contribution can dramatically affect the model and subsequent learning.

However, science teachers often struggle with enacting culturally responsive pedagogies (CRP). This paper utilizes data from classroom observations, group interviews, and numerous program artifacts to describe four themes associated with the knowledge and practices of six high school life science teachers as they learned about and attempted to enact CRP while participating in a professional development program. These themes include views of students that changed from a focus on indirect experiences and emphasizing what students lacked to direct experiences and discussions of resources that they brought to the classroom; repositioning of students and teachers that was originally undetectable but moved to situating students as leaders with authoritative knowledge that constructed products together; community building that was done to promote interaction, learning, and give voice to students; and utilizing a CRP toolbox of responsive strategies and relevant topics to create bridges between students’ homes and school. At times, however, there was little connection to families’ funds of knowledge and sporadic critical consciousness raising.

Drawing on the insights emerging from a cognitive history of science, we argue for a conception of scientific reasoning based on six “styles of scientific reasoning.” Each “style” requires its own specific ontological and procedural entities, and invokes its own epistemic values and constructs. Consequently, learning science requires the development of not just content knowledge but, in addition, procedural knowledge, and epistemic knowledge. Previous attempts to develop a coherent account of scientific reasoning have neglected the significance of either procedural knowledge, epistemic knowledge, or both. In contrast, “styles of reasoning” do recognize the need for all three elements of domain-specific knowledge, and the complexity and situated nature of scientific practice. Most importantly, “styles of reasoning” offer science education a means of valorizing the intellectual and cultural contribution that the sciences have made to contemporary thought, an argument that is sorely missing from common rationales for science education. Second, the construct of “styles of reasoning” offers a more coherent conceptual schema for the construct of scientific reasoning—one of the major goals of any education in the sciences. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Osborne, J.; Graduate School of Education, Stanford UniversityUnited States; email: osbornej@stanford.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This instrumental case study examines one teacher's efforts to teach science for equity across two contexts: a public middle school and a summer program for low-income students of color. By tracing intersecting tensions experienced when trying to teach science more equitably, we describe how systems of tensions can serve multiple functions: (1) as roadblocks for teachers when knowledge-production predicaments arise, (2) as dilemmas to be managed by teachers when there is difficulty defining educational disparities, and (3) as potentially productive as teachers and educational researchers wrestle with inherent tensions between models for teaching. Findings afford insight into why teachers experience uneven progress as they work to teach science for equity. Further examination of tensions teaching science for equity reveals deep paradoxes extending beyond the case of a single teacher into pedagogical frameworks underlying expectations for teaching science more equitably in schools. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Braaten, M.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, University of Wisconsin–MadisonUnited States; email: melissa.braaten@wisc.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This work coordinates and aligns complementary methodological and theoretical approaches to learning to both unpack sensemaking and better understand the conditions that facilitate it. I conceptualize people's sense of what constitutes a good explanation as taking place along a multidimensional metric and discuss three dimensions of this metric that are central to the evaluation of explanations of phenomena in the physical world: (1) intuitive knowledge, (2) mechanism, and (3) framing. The study operationalizes each dimension in terms that can be empirically tracked in students’ talk, gestures, and social interactions. The power and function of the multidimensional metric is illustrated through its account of the evolution of self-generated explanations of two seventh-grade girls who attempt to understand why a plastic bottle shrinks when air is pumped out of it. The analysis demonstrates that the framework can explain conviction in an explanation, preference for one explanation over another, and the complex conditions that facilitate this change.

Ninety-two teachers in three states implemented our modified materials over six curricular units from two publishers: Holt (a reading-focused curriculum) and Full Option Science System (FOSS) (an inquiry-focused curriculum). Results were compared between two interventions—one based on selected principles of cognitive science (cognitive-science-based) that included instruction in diagram comprehension and one providing professional development in science content only (content-only)—and a business-as-usual control. We analyze posttest items involving different degrees of reliance on diagrams to show how instruction in diagram comprehension can improve comprehension of diagrams during reasoning. At the classroom level, there were significant advantages of the cognitive-science-based intervention over both content-only and business-as-usual with large effect sizes in all FOSS units (d = 0.41–0.52), but only one Holt unit (d = 0.11). Analyses by type of diagram suggested these effects were largest for transfer to diagrams from an uninstructed domain. Further analyses of high-stakes state test scores available for the participants implementing the Holt units showed improved use of diagrams (d = 0.45–0.66). Results suggest that making sense of visualizations (diagrams) is not effortless and self-evident, but that students who receive supports for comprehending can improve their comprehension, and the learning can transfer to new domains. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"ED, U.S. Department of Education","This research was supported by award #R305C080009 from the U.S. Department of Education, The 21st Century Center for Research and Development in Cognition and Science Instruction (F.

Previous studies have found that some science teaching techniques can be very effective in generating situational interest among students, but the reasons why these are effective remain unclear: Hands-on activities, for example, are known to generate situational interest, but there is little consensus about the underlying reasons why. The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying causes of situational interest in a range of science teaching techniques. The participants were 229 Australian preservice elementary teachers in a one-semester science course. An open-ended survey was administered on three occasions during the course, and individual interviews with a subset of 25 students were held at the end of the semester. The teaching techniques that generated situational interest included hands-on activities, personal anecdotes, fun facts, demonstrations of science toys, science magic, clear explanations, and the use of models and artifacts. For each technique, situational interest was due to a combination of three underlying causes: success, relevance, and novelty. It was concluded that substantial situational interest occurred when these students successfully learnt something that had novelty and personal relevance. It was concluded that this triadic combination represented the underlying causes of situational interest in the course. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Palmer, D.H.; School of Education, University of NewcastleAustralia; email: David.Palmer@newcastle.edu.au",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

We suggest that in order for students to be able to construct scientific explanations, it is important to clearly and explicitly distinguish between causes that make a difference to the production of effects and the processes through which these effects are produced in developing evolutionary and developmental explanations for the origin of biological traits. However, these distinctions are not usually made in textbooks and curricula, and it is unclear how biology teachers themselves explain the origins of biological traits. In this study, we present the conclusions from the analysis of the explanations that 19 preservice biology teachers gave for the origins of biological traits. The results indicate that they often referred to causes and processes in their evolutionary explanations, but that they did not always do this in their developmental explanations. We suggest that future biology teachers should understand the structure of explanations for the origins of traits to efficiently teach their students to construct such kinds of explanations. ï¿½ 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Kampourakis, K.; Section of Biology and IUFE, University of GenevaSwitzerland; email: kostas.kampourakis@unige.ch",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In this respect, authentic scientific practices are interpreted as the totality of human work situated in society. Within such authentic scientific practices, the activities, content, and tools are connected logically and the relevance is clear among its participants. This study presents an activity-based instructional framework that assists educational designers in transforming authentic scientific practices for the population of students in science education. The activity-based instructional framework has been dialectically constructed with the design and classroom enactment of a curriculum unit based on an authentic chemical modeling practice. The curriculum unit was developed through a participatory design process that took teachers’ expertise into account. The pedagogical decisions were abstracted in design guidelines. The curriculum unit was implemented multiple times in classroom to evaluate the design guidelines. Research data were collected by means of audio-taped discussions, completed worksheets, and written questionnaires. The findings supported the potential of transforming authentic scientific practices to achieve meaningful science education. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Prins, G.T.; Freudenthal Institute, Utrecht UniversityNetherlands; email: g.t.prins@uu.nl",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

A core scientific practice is engagement in scientific modeling to build conceptual understanding about discipline-specific concepts. Yet scientific modeling remains underemphasized in elementary science learning environments, and little past research has explored early learners’ engagement in domain-specific modeling practices. Here we report on a design-based study to investigate the ways in which third-grade students generate model-based explanations about two core plant growth and development processes: plant structure/function and plant life cycles. First, using design-based research, we developed and empirically tested a learning performance framework that integrates discipline-specific content with scientific practice to examine third-grade students’ engagement in epistemic features of model-based explanations about plant growth and development. Next, we used the learning performance framework as a rubric to measure third-grade students mechanism-based scientific explanations generated from the models they developed prior to and after a long-term plant curriculum enactment. Findings from the learning performance highlight that students hold conceptual resources about plant processes and use this knowledge to reason in sophisticated ways. However, our findings from the pre/postmodels suggest that when students do not have opportunities to build conceptual knowledge, they depend on anthropomorphic analogies to reason about plant processes. Study findings imply that third-grade students require more sophisticated opportunities in building knowledge about how and why plant processes occur so they can use this knowledge to scientifically reason about how and why plants grow, develop, and survive. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Zangori, L.; Department of Learning, Teaching, and Curriculum, College of Education, University of MissouriUnited States; email: zangoril@missouri.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

The elementary science specialist model represents an alternative to the traditional model of classroom teachers providing science instruction. Although changing who teaches science may remove personal challenges, we do not know if the specialist alone can overcome the school-based challenges to teaching science. This study explored how school supports for science teaching varied across five elementary schools with science specialists through a qualitative comparative case study methodology. Drawing upon theory from organizational studies, school supports were conceptualized as four interrelated dimensions: (1) leadership, (2) resources, (3) culture, and (4) the external environment. Findings indicate that the science specialist model alone is insufficient to overcome school-based challenges to science teaching. Findings also reveal the potential danger of the specialist model to marginalize science as a content area.

Whereas the ecologists all mentioned causal claims (i.e., claims that attempt to offer an underlying cause for natural phenomena), school argumentation tasks asked students to construct and critique mainly descriptive claims (i.e., claims that describe natural phenomena) and prescriptive claims (i.e., claims about human decision making). Furthermore, while ecologists emphasized the importance of critique in their arguments, school argumentation tasks generally ignored this aspect. The lack of materials addressing causal claims raises questions: Why are these types of claims absent from school science, and how can we design tasks that ask students to construct and, importantly, critique such claims?. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Macpherson, A.C.; American Museum of Natural HistoryUnited States; email: amacpherson@amnh.org",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Yet we have few accounts of how thoughtful attempts at responsive teaching unfold across units of instruction in elementary science classrooms and have only begun to understand how responsiveness encourages rigor in conversations. In this study, the first author taught an electric circuits unit to four upper elementary science classes, exercising a responsive teaching stance. We found that rigorous episodes of whole-class talk were associated with the teacher's use of open-ended questions, follow-up prompts, references to activity or representations, prediscussion tasks, and asking students to comment on their peers’ ideas. Overall, higher rigor talk co-occurred with these conditions when used in combination. Despite being responsive to students’ emerging ideas, all four classes addressed the science ideas for the unit—an outcome we attribute to the use of an anchoring phenomenon and the teacher's awareness of the concepts required to construct evidence-based explanations for it. Finally, concerted attempts to teach in responsive ways—while also attending to rigor—surfaced pedagogical tensions that problematize efforts to create such discourse-rich environments and inform how this type of instruction might be enacted by others. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Colley, C.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, College of Education, University of WashingtonUnited States; email: cdawson1@uw.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Given the complex and cumulative nature of science and technology learning, and the highly variable and free-choice nature of science center experiences, an epidemiological research approach was used. Quantitative surveys were administered to 6,089 adults living in 17 communities located in 13 countries; all with active science centers. Data collection and analysis protocols ensured a representative sampling based on age, education, and income from each of the 17 participating communities. Results showed that individuals who used science centers had significantly higher understanding, interest and curiosity, participation in free-choice leisure activities, and identity relative to science and technology than did individuals who did not visit; even when potential self-selection biases such as income, education level, and prior interest were taken into consideration.

The study relies on analysis of video data using headcams from classroom activities and fieldwork. A year later, we asked the same students to apply rock identification to samples that were new to them. Results indicate that the teaching approach influenced the students’ opportunities for developing an understanding of rock identification. The students in case A identified the samples by applying specific names of rocks and geological terminology, which led to errors and misconnections. Their application of rock identification can be characterized as name-dropping. By contrast, the students in case B identified rocks by noticing the patterns. They also explained theories of rock formation and geological terminology, thus demonstrating understanding.

To investigate this shift in more detail, this study investigated 5- to 11-year-old children's understanding of motion down curved slopes, addressing the changing interaction of horizontal and vertical dimensions along a single trajectory. This allows for a close examination of the notion of children's ability to integrate horizontal and vertical motion knowledge as opposed to encountering a third conceptual-reasoning component within the commonsense theories framework. Children (N = 115) participated in one of three motion conditions – straight incline, convex incline, and concave incline. They predicted motions of two balls (heavy versus light) down the slopes, addressing comparisons between sections of the trajectory (shallow, intermediate, and steep incline). The results suggest that children do appear to integrate information about horizontal and vertical motion when judging motion down inclines, arguing for a two-component commonsense theory system.

In the literature, the findings generally show that primary students enjoy science but come to lose interest during secondary school. As this claim is based mainly on interview and questionnaire data, that is on secondary reports from students about their interest in science, these results are reexamined through our own extensive material from primary and secondary school on how interest is constituted through classroom discourse. Our results suggest the possibility that primary students do not lose their interest in science, but rather that an interest in science is never constituted. The overview indicates that studies relying on interviews and questionnaires make it difficult to ascertain what the actual object of interest is when students act in the science classroom. The possibility suggested should, if valid, have consequences for science education and be worthy of further examination. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Wickman, P.-O.; Department of Mathematics and Science Education, Stockholm UniversitySweden; email: per-olof.wickman@mnd.su.se",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Given its importance, research on the validity of instruments specifically developed for LSA is still sparse, especially in science and its subdomains biology, chemistry, and physics. However, policy decisions for the improvement of educational quality based on LSA can only be helpful if valid information on students’ achievement levels is provided. In the present study, the nature of the measurement instruments based on the German Educational Standards in Biology is examined. On the basis of data from 3,165 students in Grade 10, we present dimensional analyses and report the relationship between different subdimensions of biology literacy and cognitive covariates such as general cognitive abilities and verbal skills. A theory-driven two-dimensional model fitted the data best. Content knowledge and scientific inquiry, two subdimensions of biology literacy, are highly correlated and show differential correlational patterns to the covariates. We argue that the underlying structure of biology should be incorporated into curricula, teacher training and future assessments. © 2016 The Authors.

This could be influenced by teachers’ pedagogical design capacity (PDC), which considers teaching as a design activity influenced by both instructional resources (such as tools and professional development (PD)) and teacher resources (such as beliefs and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK)). In this study, we investigated how the development of five upper elementary and middle school teachers’ beliefs and PCK impacted their design and integration of argumentation within their instruction. Data sources included pre- and postsurveys, videotaped lessons, and interviews. Our analyses resulted in two groups of teachers. While several teachers offloaded some of their lesson design by using PD resources, others adapted the PD resources and renamed an aspect of their current instruction as argumentation. Moreover, the teachers who offloaded some of their lesson design exhibited argumentation within their instruction and greater change in their beliefs or PCK for argumentation. This suggests the importance of future teacher education experiences supporting teachers’ PDC by providing multiple opportunities to offload, try out, and reflect on instruction. Future research should explore whether teachers understanding of the PDC framework supports their understanding of argumentation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Knight-Bardsley, A.; Egan Maritime Institute & Nantucket Public SchoolsUnited States; email: aknight@eganmaritime.org",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Recent studies, however, suggest that contextual factors influence students’ argument quality. The authors hypothesize that a key limiting factor lies in students’ abilities to recognize when to employ knowledge related to argumentative reasoning. Students hold knowledge that can remain inert if the context fails to trigger access. The article reports on two experiments exploring the influence of context on recognition of argumentative reasoning. Each experiment used performance on a categorization task as the dependent variable. The first experiment (E1) tested the effect of targeted cues on participants’ identification of fallacious reasoning patterns. The second experiment (E2) examined the role of scenario context. E1 revealed a significant advantage in promoting detection of fallacious reasoning patterns when targeted cues were present. E2 suggests that the broad context of scenarios also influences reasoning patterns. These findings reveal that lack of knowledge of argument may not be the principal constraint on students’ argument abilities. Rather, contextual details can have a significant influence on activation of knowledge bases that contribute to argumentative reasoning.

The former worldview is consistent in many respects with assumptions that are grounded on positivism, whereas the latter worldview provides an alternative understanding of NOS, which is predominately based in the techniques of hermeneutics and historical sciences. We subsequently attempt to present the current inadequacies and weaknesses that the NOS field is challenged with as a result of not incorporating the differences between the Newtonian and neo-Darwinian worldviews into its research or instructional agenda.

It is the interactions between these agents that give rise to emergent, aggregate-level behaviors in complex systems.

In this paper, we report on a 2-week long proof-of-concept study conducted in a third-grade classroom of 15 students in which students began with an embodied modeling activity of foraging behavior, followed with the generation of mathematical inscriptions based on their embodied actions, and finally, conducted further inquiry of interdependence in an ecosystem using two separate ABMs. Furthermore, we show that the lens of mechanistic reasoning can be productively used to identify the process of students’ conceptual development of interdependence in an ecosystem as they engage in the modeling activities. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Sengupta, P.; Department of Learning Sciences, Werklund School of Education, University of CalgaryCanada; email: Pratim.sengupta@ucalgary.ca",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Results showed that the IDEA can produce reliable and valid measures of student understanding of the energy concept in different science disciplines. No statistical difference was found between the average difficulties of items across disciplines. In addition, the four science disciplines were positively correlated in terms of student understanding of the energy concept. When item difficulties were analyzed by science content topics, it was found that students have difficulty in understanding the energy concept in atomic structure, wave, electric and magnetic energy, and modern physics content areas.

As a result, many students use memorization and rote learning as a coping strategy when presented with molecular-level concepts. This study explores the potential of a new educational approach that aims at facilitating students to interpret animations and graphics of (sub)cellular processes as mechanistic explanations based on molecular interactions so as to bridge the explanatory gap between the molecular and cellular levels. The study presents the theoretical basis for a learning trajectory based on molecular mechanistic reasoning and shows in a small-scale test of the educational approach that it is within reach for pre-university students (aged 17-18 years) to interpret the visual models of (sub)cellular processes using a multilevel mechanistic perspective on (sub)cellular events. It is argued that this perspective helps students get to grips with cellular complexity in life science education. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"van Mil, M.H.W.; Molecular Cancer Research, University Medical Centre UtrechtNetherlands; email: M.H.W.vanMil@UMCUtrecht.nl",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Carried out in a public high school in the San Francisco Bay Area, students recruited for the study (N = 86) were randomly assigned to read either a racially framed or a nonracially framed textbook passage on genetic diseases as part of a unit on Mendelian genetics. Afterwards, they responded to two instruments measuring belief in the biological/genetic basis of race and one measure that recorded their explanations of the racial achievement gap and their willingness to volunteer their free time to fix it. Results demonstrated that students in the racially framed condition exhibited significantly greater agreement in the genetic basis of racial difference than students in the nonracially framed condition. A content analysis of students' explanations of the achievement gap also demonstrated that a significantly greater proportion of students gave genetic explanations of the achievement gap in the racially framed condition compared to the other condition. Furthermore, students' prior beliefs about race interacted with the reading treatments to affect students' willingness to fix the racial achievement gap. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Donovan, B.M.; Stanford Graduate School of Education, Stanford UniversityUnited States; email: briand79@stanford.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Yet, exposure to excellent science instruction in elementary school is haphazard at best and often inequitable. Although the research community has attended to the role of teacher traits, such as attitude and preparation, very little research examines the role of policy and context in constraining or supporting such best practices at the elementary level. This study attempts to fill this need through a multilevel model of how teacher traits, socioeconomic context (SE context), and accountability pressures predict students' opportunity to engage in hands-on and laboratory science education. Results indicate accountability pressure eclipsed all other predictors, including SE context, in accounting for variance in the model. Final analysis indicates that teachers at high accountability pressure schools spent about 60% less time using hands-on and laboratory teaching methods than teachers at lower accountability pressure schools, an equity issue given the distribution of underrepresented students. Teacher traits including professional development, experience, attitude, and degree were insignificant in the model. This has implications for efforts to improve elementary science education in the United States, as research and national priorities have been focused primarily on teacher development. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Hayes, K.N.; Department of Educational Leadership, California State UniversityUnited States; email: kathryn.hayes@csueastbay.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

We describe the design and implementation of a learning activity that uses concrete models to improve students' representational competence and achievement in an undergraduate chemistry course. In the study, we embedded modeling workshops into the normal course of instruction and measured their effectiveness for improving representational competence. The results indicate that, independent of instructor, the learning activity significantly improved students' ability to identify spatial information in disciplinary diagrams and translate among molecular representations compared to students who did not complete the activity. We also compared the effectiveness of the modeling workshops to improve achievement on summative course assessments. Despite demonstrated improvement in representational competence, students who received the intervention did not perform significantly better than a control group on course assessments. Finally, we surveyed students who completed the workshops to investigate their beliefs about the utility of concrete models for learning chemistry.

This article examines the role that language plays in a scientific literacy test for which everyday life is an augmented aspect. Video-recorded data was collected in four ninth-grade science classes in a Swedish compulsory school as small groups of students discussed and collaboratively solved Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) science test items. The theoretical framework assumes sociocultural perspectives as well as that of Wittgenstein's later works on language. The study involves an analysis of students' meaning making of specific words that occur in the test and the various language games to which these words contribute. Specifically, we analyzed the students' use of four different words: reference, constant, pattern, and factor. We found that the students use these words in everyday or mathematical language games; for example, understanding the word ""pattern"" as a mathematical regularity rather than a result of a scientific experiment. The results were analyzed in relation to the specific illustrations and wording that contextualize the items. We argue that a crucial part of being scientifically literate is privileging science content over other possible disciplines and contexts and ignoring the everyday perspective. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"Dnr 721‐2008‐4717, VR, Vetenskapsrådet; MAW 2012.0094","The authors wish to acknowledge the anonymous reviewers for the thoughtful insights and suggestions made on earlier versions of this manuscript.

NOS is frequently tied to a critical contextual empiricism (CCE) framework for knowledge production. Central to CCE is that objectivity is attained only with an integration of the rational and social within a diverse community of scholars that is open to criticism. The field of sexual selection theory is ripe with opportunities to present NOS in an explicit and reflective context that promotes the understanding of knowledge production as simultaneously social and rational. We examined the presentation of sexual selection theory in college evolutionary biology textbooks to evaluate the extent to which textbooks demonstrate uptake of change in the field and use socially driven critique to present science as both social and rational. All of the textbooks incorporated new research in the field and some provided context about how and why the field has changed but not to the degree warranted by the rich literature available.

Prior research has shown that increasing contextual linkages between science and mathematics is associated with student problem solving and conceptual understanding. However, few studies explicitly test the benefits of specific instructional mechanisms for fostering such linkages. We test the effect of students developing a modeled process mathematical equation of a scientific phenomenon. Links between mathematical variables and processes within the equation and fundamental entities and processes of the scientific phenomenon are embedded within the equation. These connections are made explicit as students participate in model development. Pre-post gains are tested in students from diverse high school classrooms studying inheritance. Students taught using this instructional approach are contrasted against students in matched classrooms implementing more traditional instruction (Study 1) or prior traditional instruction from the same teachers (Study 2). Students given modeled process instruction improved more in their ability to solve complex mathematical problems compared to traditionally instructed students. These modeled process students also show increased conceptual understanding of mathematically modeled processes. The observed effects are not due to differences in instructional time or teacher effects. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Schuchardt, A.M.; Learning Research and Development Center, University of PittsburghUnited States; email: ams417@pitt.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This situation means preservice teachers often see few connections between the research-based principles for teaching science they learn in university-based coursework and the science teaching practices they see in their classroom field placements. We attempted to resolve this situation by creating opportunities for preservice and mentor teachers to learn together. We developed colearning tasks where preservice and mentor teachers collaborated to apply principles of science inquiry and equitable learning to analyze and modify common elementary science curriculum materials. We borrowed from the field of ecology to develop an edge effects framework that enabled an analysis of when and how preservice and mentor teachers connected principle- and practical-based discourses while engaged in the colearning tasks. Our findings suggest that the colearning tasks supported preservice and mentor teachers in connecting research-based principles to practical classroom contexts. However, working on these tasks together was sometimes challenging for both preservice and mentor teachers. We discuss the affordances and constraints of the colearning tasks and the framing of the principle–practical divide as an edge rather than a gap. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"DRL‐1019860, NSF, National Science Foundation","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DRL‐1019860.",,,"Gunckel, K.L.; Department of Teaching, Learning, and Sociocultural Studies, University of Arizona, P.O.

Using exploratory latent class analysis, a four-class model was identified as the best model, based on model fit and interpretability. Although the low and typical profiles had uniform levels of indicators, the two high motivation profiles (high self-efficacy and high utility value) had mixed levels. The profile characterized by very high self-efficacy had lower values, while the profile characterized by high utility value had lower self-efficacy. The differences in math achievement between profiles were small. High-ability students disidentified with science; only 29% of high-ability students had high science expectancy-value profiles.

Taking a cue from school effectiveness research and reframing our approach using systems thinking, this study examined school-level variables associated with equitable science achievement. In particular, this study explores the concept of trust in relation to science education. Building upon a substantial body of research literature, we offer refined conceptualizations of schoolwide trust along with the findings that trust fluctuates according to the type of interpersonal relationship, that teacher views of the school principal's trustworthiness are considerably more variable than views of fellow teachers’ trustworthiness, and that schoolwide science achievement is associated with perceptions of the school principal's trustworthiness. This study supports the view that trustworthy professional relationships are one of several complementary organizational resources that promote effective and equitable science education. Moreover, our study identified aspects of school trust corresponding to school-level student science outcomes, and these differed from results reported elsewhere for math and reading/language-arts achievement. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Smetana, L.K.; Loyola University Chicago, School of EducationUnited States; email: LSmetana@luc.edu",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

However, research has shown that this connection does not always bear out because the assumption does not attend to the context in which students’ epistemological understandings are accessed. This study presents a microgenetic analysis of two students’ model-construction endeavor to explore how context-sensitive analyses influence our characterization of a student's epistemological sophistication. In this analysis, we show that both students held a target epistemological resource but that they did not apply this resource to their final model design consistently. In addition, we show that one student articulated why she applied one epistemological resource instead of the other while the other student did not. We use this case study to explore possible definitions of epistemological sophistication. We conclude that evaluations of epistemological sophistication should focus on the ways in which students discuss their epistemological decisions rather than on the epistemological underpinnings of their knowledge construction work.

Thus, referring to individuals’ possibly inarticulate knowledge of knowing and learning as “epistemology” is misappropriation of the term. Sandoval ( ) has also argued that educational researchers typically, and problematically, conflate theories of knowing with theories of learning under the single title of “epistemology.” In this paper we use the term epistemology for two reasons: (1) it is commonly used in science education in the way in which we use it (i.e., to mean student tacit or explicit understandings, beliefs, or ideas about the nature, source, and form of knowledge and implications for learning) and (2) as argued by Elby ( ), knowledge of knowing and knowledge of learning are inextricably linked and separating them now, before we understand that relationship, may obfuscate the relationships between that knowledge and action.

Alignment of orientations and beliefs shows that orientations override preservice teachers’ notions of science teaching.

In this paper, I use the instructional systems-of-practice framework and the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol (TDOP) to advance an approach to thinking about teaching in science classrooms in more multidimensional terms. Using descriptive statistics and social network analysis, I examine the teaching practices employed by a group of science and engineering faculty (n = 56). Results indicate the extensive use of lecturing with premade visuals (observed in 65% of all 2-minute intervals comprising a class). However, the majority of instructors (n = 34) lectured for periods of 20 minutes or less.

Such opportunities begin with elementary teachers implementing coherent and well-sequenced inquiry-based investigations in their classrooms. This study explored how preservice teachers (N = 30) planned inquiry-based investigations for elementary students. The preservice teachers spent the first 5 weeks of their methods course participating in astronomy investigations and then pair-taught astronomy investigations once a week for 5 weeks to elementary students in afterschool programs. We analyzed lesson plans, teaching reflections, and pre/post astronomy content assessments. One-third of the pairs developed coherent science inquiry investigations across all of their lessons. Their reflections suggest that preservice teachers who developed coherent inquiry investigations held normative ideas about scientific inquiry and were more likely to reflect on sense-making practices than preservice teachers who did not plan for coherent science inquiry investigations in their lessons. Preservice teachers' postinstruction astronomy content knowledge was positively correlated with an increased number of lessons spent on coherent science inquiry investigations.

A Web-based learning environment, SOCRATES, was developed, which included a rich data base on the topic of climate change. Sixteen 11th graders, working with a partner, engaged in electronic argumentive dialogs with classmates who held an opposing view on the topic and in some evidence-focused reflective activities, based on transcriptions of their dialogs. Another sixteen 11th graders, who studied the data base in the learning environment for the same amount of time as experimental-condition students but did not engage in an argumentive discourse activity, served as a comparison condition. Students who engaged in an evidence-focused dialogic intervention increased the use of evidence in their dialogs, used more evidence that functioned to weaken opponents' claims and used more accurate evidence. Significant gains in evidence use and in metalevel communication about evidence were observed after students engaged in reflective activities.

This case is drawn from a year-long qualitative research study that examined Michael's process of learning to teach high school biology and describes how his avoidance of evolution in his own education led to further disengagement with evolution in his methods coursework and in his student teaching practice. Paradoxically, his high academic abilities obscured substantive knowledge gaps about evolution, and his content knowledge regarding evolution did not appear to improve as a result of his student teaching experience. Kohl's concept of ""not-learning"" is useful in understanding Michael's avoidance of learning evolution. His use of the discourse of evolution in coursework and in student teaching activities also helped to obscure his opposition to learning evolution. We present an argument that proficiency for teaching biology means not only tolerating evolution as a topic to be covered in class but also advocating for evolution as a foundational theme in the discipline.

We describe DeltaTick, a graphical simulation construction interface for the NetLogo modeling environment designed to make computational model construction a more accessible and responsive part of science and mathematics curricular activities through domain-specific, customizable construction libraries. With DeltaTick, learners assemble and reassemble predefined sets of ""behavior blocks"" to build simulations that represent a particular domain of study. When needed, blocks can be added, adjusted, or replaced to better reflect student knowledge, interests, or questions. We present coding analyses and vignettes from DeltaTick enactments in middle and high school classrooms to illustrate ways these features allowed learners to explore core curricular ideas, while also accommodating emergent student or classroom needs. From these findings, we posit two principles, curricular example space and levels of responsivity, for the design of computational modeling environments intended for classrooms.

Data for the study are derived from a design experiment that involves a technology-rich, inquiry-based sequence of activities. We draw on interaction analysis to examine the work by means of which a group of upper secondary school students make sense of a number of different ways in which a physical phenomenon-a phase transition-is presented to them. Our analytical perspective, grounded in a cultural-historical framework, involves scrutinizing how the different materials emerge and evolve as signifiers for something other than themselves during teacher-student and student-student transactions. This approach allows us to trace the emergence of students' interpretations of the relations between phenomena and their diverse presentations without committing to any preconceived notion of what these presentations stand for. We describe how students' bodily and pragmatic actions become reified in conceptual terms and how these relate to lived-in experiences rather than to formal underlying concepts.

Deterministic research claims have been critiqued for their conceptual limitations as well as social implications. The study details the criteria used by 30 Indian students in their critical evaluation of a deterministic claim in a media article related to neurogenetics. Based on literature that discusses values in science, we categorize students' responses into those motivated by epistemic and ultimate values, and make some qualitative inferences regarding their value-loaded critical thinking. We find that students exhibit varying levels of sophistication while critiquing foundational assumptions of the fallacious claim with a few resorting to narrow, discipline-based frameworks. Students proposed linear cause-effect models of the genotype-phenotype relationship and drew on disciplinary knowledge that is elementary in nature when discussing this relationship. We also find that only a few students critiqued these claims from social and ethical perspectives.

Based on an analysis of classroom observation and interview data, I argue that their decisions to take science and mathematics courses were ways of negotiating their positions as members of a racial minority, English learners, and Koreans with stereotyped characteristics. In the class, they encountered challenges related to various modes of language used in advanced science classes, such as unfamiliar science terms, complex texts, social linguistic skills required in discursive practices, and various knowledge going beyond class texts.

However, sociocultural factors may overshadow these perceptions when people are forced to make personally impacting choices contextualized within actual socioscientific issues. This investigation determined 324 secondary students' perceptions about global warming (GW) science and willingness to mitigate GW across five categories of actions-each requiring varying levels of personal sacrifice (e.g., supporting GW education versus limiting personal reproduction). Identified sociocultural indicators among the students included ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic classification. Results indicate that GW science views and sociocultural factors became less impactful on the participants' willingness to mitigate GW as the GW-mitigating actions required greater personal involvement and sacrifice. However, most consistently significantly predicting willingness to mitigate GW was the participants' perceptions about the validity of GW science claims. Furthermore, while the participants' perceptions about the nature of GW science methods significantly influenced their willingness to enact certain GW-mitigating actions, socioeconomic classification and ethnicity were oftentimes stronger indicators of the participants' inclination to mitigate GW. Implications for education discussed include promoting responsible socioscientific decision making through contextually teaching about how and why GW science is valid while also considering how sociocultural factors can impact socioscientific choices. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Herman, B.C.; Department of Teaching and Learning, University of South FloridaUnited States",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This approach has challenges, as interest in a topic may not necessarily indicate interest in scientific practices and pursuits. An underexplored and perhaps productive way to gauge and foster interest in science is to understand the ways in which students express curiosity about the nature of an object, phenomena, or a given topic. This study explores the nature and prevalence of students' expressions of science-relevant curiosity such as wonderment about causal mechanisms, teleological explanations, and inconsistencies in observations. We coded student photojournal entries and interview responses to explore (1) how wonderment can be characterized not by science topic or domain, but rather by the aspects of scientific inquiry practice they reflect, (2) the variation in such science-relevant curiosity expression in a small sample (N = 19) of sixth-grade students, and (3) how individual variation in curiosity expression relates to reported interest in science. We found that a qualitative approach using photojournaling and interviews captured a wide variation in curiosity expression among students, and brief cases analyses (N = 3) demonstrate that students with differing patterns of curiosity expression talk about their interest in science differently. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Luce, M.R.; Graduate School of Education, Stanford UniversityUnited States",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Context-based education has been proposed as a partial solution to this problem. This study aims to gain insight into the development of conceptual coherence and how context-embedded learning-teaching activities (LT) can promote this. We describe a case study in which a context-based lesson sequence about protein-rich food production was designed and conducted in a 10th-grade biology class. The conceptual framework consisted of transformations of forms of energy and matter in photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and biosynthesis. All relevant concepts and their interconnections (propositions) were captured in a reference concept map. A research scenario was used to evaluate whether the lesson sequence was conducted as intended. Learning outcomes were determined by analyzing written products on the occurrence of propositions from the reference concept map. Additional interviews provided insight into the development of conceptual coherence in relation to three context-embedded LT activities: using graphic visualizations, writing, and concept mapping. The results indicated that students improved in mentioning propositions from the reference concept map. Propositions relating metabolic processes and including forms of energy were still difficult. Finally, successful elements of the three LT activities are considered. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..",,,,,,,"Ummels, M.H.J.; Radboud Graduate School of Education, Radboud UniversityNetherlands",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In this study, we attempted to understand how the language of science textbooks works to represent the world for students in distinct ways that have serious implications for their ecological literacy. Using a methodological framework based on critical discourse analysis and systemic functional linguistics, we focused on clarifying the textual representations of the relationships between natural and social systems as portrayed in a seventh-grade science textbook that is widely adopted in middle schools in Georgia, United States. Results indicate that this science textbook offers outdated representations of natural systems' relationships with social systems and the role of human agency in these relationships.

Despite the fact that most adults who are finished with their formal education get their science knowledge from such free-choice learning settings very little is known about the effect of stereoscopic film presentation on their science learning. We explored this issue by designing a quasi-experimental field trial with a short film about the shape of the Milky Way galaxy. The film was produced based on a set of stereoscopic design principles derived from spatial cognition and cognitive load literature with the goal of lowering the audience's extraneous cognitive load. The film was randomly shown in either two-dimensional (2D) or stereoscopic format to 498 adults who visited a large, urban planetarium. To investigate the extent of audience's change related to galaxy-related spatial concepts, an identical set of questions was asked on iPads before and after the film was shown. A delayed posttest was given to 123 of those adults approximately 6 months later. Test performances were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of covariances (ANCOVAs) with demographic and spatial visualization ability measures as covariates. Results show identical short-term learning gains in both the 2D and stereoscopic groups. However, only the stereoscopic group exhibited long-term learning gains. Findings were interpreted through the lenses of cognitive load theory and the limited capacity model of mediated message processing. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"DRL‐1114645, NSF, National Science Foundation; GNU, Gyeongsang National University","The project was funded by National Science Foundation award DRL‐1114645 and supported by the American Association of Variable Star Observers under the direction of Dr. Arne Henden.

This qualitative multiple case study examines 14 preservice science teachers' (PSTs) responses to learning opportunities created to develop this capacity, as provided by a teacher preparation program. The PSTs engaged in multiple cycles of designing assessments and analyzing student work in coordination with clinical experiences in the field. Drawing upon the notions of responsiveness and noticing, we analyze teaching episodes for whether and how the PSTs in this study attended and responded to student thinking in instructional contexts. Several teaching episodes provide evidence of PSTs' productive responsiveness-suggesting modification in specific elements of instructional design to create better conditions for advancing students' scientific thinking. In general, however, the episodes suggest uneven success in PSTs' responses to student thinking. The findings point to two considerations in designing learning opportunities to enhance PSTs' responsiveness: (a) the use of high-quality assessment tasks that make student thinking visible and (b) helping PSTs to reframe the problems by deprivatizing PSTs' interpretations of student responses. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"MSU, Michigan State University","We are grateful to the preservice teachers, mentor teachers, and science education faculty at the Michigan State University who made this research possible.

Item response theory models can be used to examine misconceptions distractor-driven multiple-choice (MDDMC) items as a method for examining patterns of student answer choices given their achievement level. Furthermore, changes in response patterns over time can yield useful information about changes in student understanding following instruction. Because it meets the requirements for invariant measurement, the Rasch model is a promising tool for examining the diagnostic properties of MDDMC items within a coherent measurement framework; however, this application of the dichotomous Rasch model in conjunction with MDDMC items is relatively unexplored (Herrmann-Abell, 2011, 2014). The purpose of this study is to explore the diagnostic information about student understanding of physical science concepts provided by a Rasch-based analysis of MDDMC items.

In naturalistic classroom settings, the teacher most often acts as an important resource and provides various forms of guidance during students' learning activities. Few studies, however, have focused on the role of teacher intervention in CSCL settings. By analyzing the interactions between secondary school students and their teacher during a science project, the current study provides insight into the concerns that teachers might encounter when facilitating students' learning processes in these types of settings. The analyses show that one main concern was creating a balance between providing the requested information and supporting students in utilizing each other's knowledge and understanding. Another concern was balancing support on an individual versus group level, and a third concern was directing the students' attention to coexisting conceptual perspectives. Most importantly, however, the analyses show how teacher intervention constitutes the pivotal ""glue"" that aids students in linking and using coexisting aspects of support such as peer collaboration, digital tools, and instructional design.

Our purpose was to inform the research base on effective equity professional development, toward the goal of better supporting science and mathematics teachers in transforming their views and practices. Because talk is central to learning, we examined how four strategies for professional learning facilitated or constrained teachers' shared equity talk: (1) engagement in teacher research, (2) reflection on personal experiences, (3) modeling of reform-based instructional practices, and (4) examination of school/state/national data on student course taking and achievement. We asked: How did teachers' shared equity talk vary across these strategies? To answer this question, we qualitatively analyzed recorded seminars, teacher interviews, and written reflections to determine the opportunities each strategy afforded teachers to talk about equity, and the length and substance of teachers' equity talk as a result. We found that, despite teachers' construction of a shared equity discourse and the iterative implementation of professional learning strategies, the type of strategy implemented did indeed matter. Although all four strategies provided teachers similar opportunities to discuss equity, some strategies were more effective than others in facilitating equity conversations. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Bianchini, J.A.; Department of Education, University of California, Santa BarbaraUnited States",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

We identify three themes (universalism, scientism, and technocentrism) that are common in scientific discourse around sustainability and show how they appear in the NGSS. Taken together, these themes evoke a technology-centered perspective called ecological modernization that defines sustainability as a set of global problems affecting all humans equally and solvable through the application of science and technology. We argue that students who are taught to think about sustainability from this perspective will be less able to see its ethical and political dimensions and less prepared for the political realities of a pluralist, democratic society that must balance the needs of multiple groups and integrate science with other sources of knowledge to develop contextualized responses to sustainability challenges. One compelling alternative is a systematic collaboration between science educators and social studies educators, in which the complementary pedagogical strengths of both fields are combined to provide realistic and powerful preparation for future sustainability challenges. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Feinstein, N.W.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, University of Wisconsin-MadisonUnited States",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

The unique combination of these instructional strategies, which we refer to as ""multicultural inquiry,"" provided students with opportunities for experiencing scientific activities and negotiating their understandings about scientific culture. Through this instructional approach, students demonstrated science learning and also came to view science as (1) more than just a subject at school, (2) different from media-based depictions, and (3) aligned with the actual disciplines of geology and paleontology. Students also demonstrated self-identification with scientists and interest in pursuing scientific careers.

The length of time that teachers received PD was the exclusive predictor of change over time, whereas a schools' percentage of low socioeconomic students predicted how PD concepts was initially implemented. Prior to PD teachers expressed a desire to increase opportunities for students to engage in SCDCs, but found some aspects more challenging than others to implement. Generally, there were three categories of the teachers' frequency of use of SCDC strategies: (a) most observed that required teachers to change their own communication, classroom management, and direct instruction; (b) occasionally observed that provided opportunities for greater oral and written discourse to facilitate students' meaning making of science; and (c) least observed that encouraged students' executive control of their learning and teachers' use of formative assessment in response to students' diverse learning needs. Teachers identified administrative support, PD strategies, and teacher collaboration as supports for implementation. However, they rated students' science knowledge, diverse language skills, and discourse abilities as the greatest barriers to implementing a SCDC. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Lewis, E.B.; Department of Teaching, Learning, and Teacher Education, College of Education and Human Science, University of Nebraska-LincolnUnited States",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

With the support of the National Science Foundation, these initial efforts sparked renewed attention to the importance of considering long‐term changes in students' knowledge and thinking about concepts that play a central organizing role in the sciences, such as matter, evolution, and energy. Because LPs provide a cross‐grades perspective on the learning of subject matter knowledge, they have been prominent in recent discussions of assessments, curricula, and standards, including the Next Generation Science Standards. Yet, it is becoming increasingly evident that the LPs now appearing in scholarly publications differ on a number of fundamental dimensions, including the aims and goals that motivated their creation, notions about what should be included in a long‐term description of student learning, the granularity of description considered most useful, the extent to which means for supporting conceptual development should be woven into the fabric of the LP, and assumptions about how LPs should be generated and tested.

Theoretical frameworks included situated learning (J. S. Brown, A. Collins, & P. Duguid, 1989), professional identity development (M. B. Brewer & W. Gardner, 1996), and a pragmatic approach to constructivist learning theory (P. Cobb, 1994). An ethnographic study was used to determine meaning from the participants' points of view. Results indicated that preservice teacher autonomy, peer collaboration, and close relationships with children were key features of the culture of the methods course. One case-study participant with an initial identity who favored a constructivist approach found opportunities to try out this approach and learn how it might be implemented. The second case-study student began the course with only a vague sense of her own science identity and tended to adopt identity elements similar to those of peers in her group.

With implementation in hundreds of classrooms across the United States, science teachers have noted PS as successful in motivating their students to engage in classroom inquiry investigations. To investigate the role of the online scientist-mentors in motivating students in the PS learning environment, we used self-determination theory (SDT) to guide a multiple case study of 10 student inquiry teams engaged in PS in a rural public school in a large Southwestern U.S. state. We used online dialogues between scientist-mentors and their assigned student inquiry teams to answer research questions about the motivational support provided by scientist-mentors and the association between this support and students' engagement in scientific inquiry.

The quasi-experimentally designed study compared learning outcomes between two curricular approaches: One built around a computer-based game, and the other built around a narrative case. The research questions addressed student learning of basic biological principles, development of interest in learning science, and how a game-based approach compared to a nongame-based approach in terms of supporting learning. The study employed a pre-post design with 1,888 high school students nested within the classes of 36 biology teachers. Results indicated that students participating in both approaches demonstrated statistically and practically significant gains on both proximal and distal assessments of biological content knowledge. Neither group demonstrated gains in science interest. The curriculum by time interaction was not statistically different, indicating that students in both groups showed similar results. Implications for game-based science learning and future research include building better awareness of technological and professional development challenges associated with implementing educational games, the need for new strategies for understanding the impacts of games for learning, and the need for cost-benefit analyses in the planning of game-based educational approaches. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"0833521, NSF, National Science Foundation","Many individuals contributed to the design, development, and implementation of the MBt/VQ project including Mary Jo Koroly, Richard Snyder, Michelle Klosterman, Tim Barko, Tamara Mandel, Julie Bokor, Julie Brown, and Felipe Echeverri.

First, we sought to understand how the research literature published between 2000 and 2014 contributed to knowledge of evolution education as well as areas required to further illuminate our understanding of evolutionary acceptance and rejection. Two hundred thirteen studies were reviewed using identified criteria that included the approach to teaching, attitudes and perceptions, religiosity, and proposed teaching methods, with particular emphasis on evolution teaching and learning. Following multiple rounds of article examination, seven general directions appear to be present in evolution education research: (1) approach to evolution in the classroom; (2) knowledge, understanding, and acceptance of evolution; (3) attitudes and perceptions of evolution; (4) factors impacting the teaching and learning of evolution; (5) evolution conflict and coping strategies; (6) evolution and religiosity; and (7) proposed evolution teaching method, courses, and assessment. The analysis pointed to four areas in need of further exploration: (1) elaboration on how worldview affects acceptance; (2) exploration of specific factors (intrinsic and extrinsic) that influence the acceptance of evolution; (3) examination of experiences to define these factors, especially among preservice teachers; and (4) exploration of evolution acceptance across geographical regions of the United States. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Glaze, A.L.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, School of Education, The University of AlabamaUnited States",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In this paper, we focus on making as an educative inquiry-based practice, and specifically tinkering as a branch of making that emphasizes creative, improvisational problem solving. STEM-rich tinkering activities are designed to support interdisciplinary investigations and creativity using a STEM-rich palette of tools, concepts, and phenomena. To date, the majority of research on making has focused on analysis of makerspaces, maker communities, and design and implementation of maker activities. In this paper, we describe a study that documented dimensions of learning in tinkering programs designed for museum visitors.

Here, we present how a statistical framework, discrete-time survival analysis, can help overcome these barriers to longitudinal assessment studies using data from our research on students' understanding of structure-property relationships in chemistry. In the study presented, we administered the Implicit Information from Lewis Structures Instrument (IILSI)-an instrument designed to elicit from students what information can be predicted using a Lewis structure-to three cohorts of students at five time points over a two-year period, throughout their general chemistry and organic chemistry courses, to determine the ways in which student ideas about structure-property relationships evolved. Using survival analysis, we were able to identify both whether and when learning occurred over the two-year period. The single model also allowed us to construct trajectories to determine the ways in which students developed the ideas that underlie structure-property relationships in chemistry. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,"We would also like to thank the Center for Statistical Training and Consulting at Michigan State University for its assistance.",,,"Underwood, S.M.; Department of Chemistry, Michigan State UniversityUnited States",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This approach viewed learning as a process in which students must go through discontinuous level transitions characterized by linguistic changes. Transposed to chemistry education, the first transition is from the ground level to the descriptive level, where students learn to describe regularities in chemical phenomena. This transition is followed by a transition to the theoretical level, where students learn the structure of these regularities. In this article, the researchers introduce the qualitative concept of chemical element, expand it to address quantitative formulas for gases, and explain it using the concept chemical atom as an indivisible unity. The researchers qualitatively analyze transcripts of discussions both between students and between students and their teacher to look for evidence of chemistry learning in accordance with the theoretical expectations. The results show the applicability of the Van Hiele theory of level transitions for chemistry learning.

By examining two distinct forms of RETs, this study incorporates 5 years of data collected from more than 100 RET participants, which include elementary, middle, and high school teachers. Evidence was drawn from analysis of multiple instruments measuring science teachers' self-efficacy (STEBI), pedagogical discontentment (STPD), teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning (TBI), and Contextual Beliefs about Teaching Science (CBATS). The results indicate that both RET programs were successful in shaping teachers' beliefs and affect-particularly in decreasing pedagogical discontentment and enhancing beliefs about reform. However, the RET program that focused mainly on teacher practice was more successful in shaping teachers' beliefs and was the only program to show an influence on teachers' practice. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Enderle, P.; Center for Education Research in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science, The Florida State UniversityUnited States",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

We conducted two studies focusing on this specific issue. We hypothesized that autonomy-support is beneficial to intrinsic motivation and cognitive achievement.

Through video-based research, the team analyzed 16 families during walks at a nature center. Each family's prior science learning experience provided conversational strategies for learning together as a social group and when making meaning out of observations in the outdoors. This analysis provides three main findings: (1) families frequently tapped into a vast repertoire of previous experiences during conversations about nature and very often, explicitly sourced a specific prior experience in their dialogue with one another; (2) when families sourced a prior experience, they almost exclusively named an experience from a nonschool setting, with everyday experiences, designed spaces (i.e., informal institutions), and programs for science learning being the most common experiences cited; and (3) families leveraged references to prior experiences during family science conversations to serve four primary facilitation processes in conversation: reminding, prompting, explaining, and orienting. Implications from this study emphasize the importance of referencing previous life experiences during family science conversations as a meaning-making tool and for additional research on families learning science in outdoor education spaces. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"McClain, L.R.; College of Education, The Pennsylvania State UniversityUnited States",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

To achieve this, we analyzed data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment, which had science as its focus. Consistently, our findings show that science students who report experiencing low levels of inquiry-oriented learning activities are found to have above-average levels of science literacy, but below-average levels of interest in science, and below-average levels on six variables that reflect students' engagement in science. Our findings show that the corollary is also true. Across the three countries, students who report high levels of inquiry-oriented learning activities in science are observed to have below-average levels of science literacy, but above-average levels of interest in learning science, and above-average engagement in science. These findings appear to run counter to science education orthodoxy that the more students experience inquiry-oriented teaching and learning, the more likely they are to have stronger science literacy, as well as more positive affect toward science.

The paper explores how certain teacher practices support or hinder students' learning. Four cases from the study were analyzed in depth using Vygotsky's concept ""the zone of proximal development"" and Wallace's notion of language authenticity. The analyses indicated that although respected pedagogical principles underlie teaching, students' use their own prior concepts to a limited degree to express their developing understanding of inquiry into scientific phenomena and ideas. The analyses showed how the teachers emphasized theoretical knowledge and hoped to enable the students to correctly interpret their observations and apply scientific theory. However, this emphasis hindered students' articulations of their developing understanding. The results indicated that working within students' zones of proximal development during practical activities requires a novel approach.

It integrates the research on multiple representations and multimodal representations by identifying and leveraging the differences in their units of analysis in two dimensions: timescale and compositional grain size. Timescale considers the duration of time a learner typically spends on one or more representations. Compositional grain size refers to the elements of interest within a representation, ranging from components such as visual elements, words, or symbols, to a representation as a whole. Research on multiple representations focuses on the practice of re-representing science concepts through different representations and is typically of long timescale and large grain size. Research on multimodal representations tends to consider how learners integrate the components of a representation to produce meaning; it is usually of finer grain size and shorter timescale. In the integrative framework, each type of analysis on multiple and multimodal representations plays a mutually complementary role in illuminating students' learning with representations. The framework is illustrated through the analysis of instructional episodes of middle school students using representations to learn nanoscience concepts over the course of a lesson unit. Finally, recommendations for new research directions stemming from this framework are presented. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Tang, K.-S.; National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, SG, 637616, Singapore; email: koksing.tang@nie.edu.sg",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In previous studies of this topic, this information was communicated verbally. The present research used diagrams, specifically trees (cladograms) depicting evolutionary relationships among taxa. Effects of college students' and 10th graders' prior knowledge on their ability to reason from information depicted in cladograms was evaluated in two ways: (1) By keeping the hierarchical branching structure constant while manipulating whether the taxa-targeted common misconceptions about biological classification or were unfamiliar; and (2) by keeping the targeted misconception constant while manipulating the strength of the evidence countermanding that misconception. Students demonstrated more sophisticated reasoning when (1) the taxa were unfamiliar, so they had to rely on the diagrammatic information presented rather than their incorrect prior knowledge, and (2) stronger evidence contradicting their incorrect prior knowledge was presented. Students' challenges to correctly interpreting evolutionary trees included lower level of schooling and greater strength of the misconception. College, but not high school, students showed some ability to transfer their better reasoning with cladograms depicting relationships among unfamiliar taxa to cladograms depicting taxon relationships that contradicted their everyday conceptions.

In this paper, we propose a socioscientific sustainability reasoning (S3R) model to analyze students' reasoning exchanges on environmental socially acute questions (ESAQs). The paper describes the development of an epistemological analysis of how sustainability perspectives can be integrated into socioscientific reasoning, which emphasizes the need for S3R to be both grounded in context and collective. We argue the complexity of ESAQs requires a consideration of multiple dimensions that form the basis of our S3R analysis model: problematization, interactions, knowledge, uncertainties, values, and governance. For each dimension, in the model we have identified indicators of four levels of complexity. We investigated the usefulness of the model in identifying improvements in reasoning that flow from cross-national web-based exchanges between groups of French and Australian students, concerning a local and a global ESAQ. The S3R model successfully captured the nature of reasoning about socioscientific sustainability issues, with the collective negotiation of multiple forms of knowledge as a key characteristic in improving reasoning levels. The paper provides examples of collaborative argumentation in collective texts (wikis) to illustrate the various levels of reasoning in each dimension, and diagrammatic representation of the evolution of collective reflections. We observe that a staged process of construction and confrontation, involving groups representing to some extent different cultural and contextual stances, is powerful in eliciting reasoned argument of enhanced quality. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Morin, O.; UMR EFTS, Toulouse, France; email: olivier.morin@univ-lyon1.fr",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This is problematic because it involves a circular reasoning leading to unwarranted claims explaining the originally studied activities of science teaching and learning. Unlike other fields within social science research, this problem has not been appreciated and discussed in the science education literature and the field thus needs to be reminded of it. A heuristic specifically developed for the purposes of this article is applied to two examples taken from a much-cited research in the field. Through the examples it is argued that the practice of creating entities out of generalizations of science classroom activities leads to a number of unintended consequences. It is further argued that the stated purposes in the two example articles would actually have been better served by investigating the entire processes through which the activities develop, as well as how the activities may change through teaching.

To what degree, therefore, can these variations be attributed to differences in educational systems as opposed to demographic differences or random variation? The current study compares student interviews across two cities in Turkey to provide insight into this question because Turkey, unlike the United States, has a strongly standardized national educational system. The results demonstrate no significant differences in students' consistency or meanings of force between cities.

The strength of the association with cognitive achievement is sufficiently noteworthy to encourage further analysis of the role of informal activities such as museum attendance on cognitive learning. The association of cognitive performance with science museum visiting was found to be only partially a product of student selectivity of parents with higher educational levels or prior achievement at earlier grades. However, student attitudes of science efficacy, utility, and anxiety in middle school were not found to be predictive or a result of frequent science museum attendance or achievement in later high school years, although attitudes and cognitive achievement did become more aligned by the 12th grade. But, no evidence is found in the analysis of the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (1987-1993) and the 2009 High School Longitudinal Survey that visiting science museums was associated with reversing the typical trend of decline in student reports of science self-efficacy or beliefs in the utility of science during high school years. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Suter, L.E.2515 Gadsby Place, Alexandria, VA 22311, United States; email: Larryesuter@gmail.com",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Students who had read the research article or the modified research article improved significantly strongest in their understanding of the constructive nature of science and the argumentative nature of science.

Participants came from four community groups in central London: a Sierra Leonean group (n = 21), a Latin American group (n = 18), a Somali group (n = 6), and an Asian group (n = 13). Using a theoretical framework based on the work of Bourdieu, the analysis suggests ISE practices were grounded in expectations about visitors' scientific knowledge, language skills, and finances in ways that were problematic for participants and excluded them from science learning opportunities. It is argued that ISE practices reinforced participants preexisting sense that museums and science centers were ""not for us.""

Our current research builds on this foundation and extends it to add more detail to understanding the types of experiences that trigger and maintain interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Using survey data from nearly 8,000 individuals, we are able to address the When?, What?, and Who? of those first experiences. Additionally, our data provide information on the types of experiences that maintained interest (or not) beyond the triggering event. Through purposeful sampling, our data include those who ended up in STEM fields and those who did not, which allows us to make important comparisons across these groups. Overall, our findings indicate that individuals who complete STEM degrees have quite varied histories and that the triggering of their interest happened across a wide age spectrum. Similarly, in terms of who was involved or what their triggering experience was, the general results support the notion that there are many pathways to STEM with no clear preferential pathway. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Maltese, A.V.; School of Education, Indiana UniversityUnited States",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Both the SBL and the MBL used computers to collect, graph, and analyze data. A major difference was that the MBL allowed the students to manipulate physical materials, whereas in the SBL activity they manipulated virtual materials. In this quasi-experimental design, two 11th-grade classes (N = 68) at an urban public high school in Taipei were assigned to the SBL and MBL settings. The participants conducted the Boyle's law experiment without having done any relevant prior experiment. Their science concepts, performance of inquiry tasks, and attitudes toward the SBL/MBL were examined by pre- and postconceptual tests, an inquiry-based lab manual, and postlaboratory interviews. The results showed that both groups performed equally well and had remarkable gains in their pre- to posttest learning achievement. Nevertheless, physical manipulation may have contributed to inquiry practices such as creating practical ideas for conducting and improving the experiment and interpreting the data and may have increased the enjoyment of the laboratory. This study concludes that virtual manipulation is as effective as physical manipulation in learning physics concepts, but that the former gives learners some naïve expectations and induces certain learning strategies that seem to lead to mindless planning and conducting of experiments and hinders them from generating ideas to improve experiments. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Chen, S.; Graduate Institute of Digital Learning and Education, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, 106, Taiwan; email: sufchen@mail.ntust.edu.tw",,"Wiley-Liss Inc.",00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Data, collected around a long-term plant investigation, included classroom observations, teacher interviews, and students' written artifacts. Study findings suggest a link between the teachers' ideas about scientific explanations, their instructional scaffolding, and students' written explanations.

Several articles have addressed the usefulness of three-dimensional (3D) simulations in astronomy education, but they have neither addressed what students discern nor the nature of that discernment. A Web-based questionnaire was designed using links to video clips drawn from a simulation video of travel through our galaxy and beyond. The questionnaire was completed by 137 participants from nine countries across a broad span of astronomy education. The descriptions provided by the participants were analyzed using hermeneutics in combination with a constant comparative approach to formulate six categories of discernment in relation to multidimensionality.

Teachers' understanding of scientific argumentation impacts how they incorporate this important scientific practice into science classrooms. This study examined how three professional development workshop series grounded in authentic practice impacted 70 elementary, middle, and high school teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) for scientific argumentation. Data sources included pre- and postsurveys, videotapes of the workshops, artifacts produced by the teachers, and samples of student writing. Results from the analysis suggest that the workshops were successful in teachers' development of PCK for argumentation in relation to the structural components of students' science writing. However, the teachers also had a number of challenges. Specifically, teachers struggled with analyzing classroom discussions for both structural and dialogic characteristics of argumentation, had difficulty applying the reasoning component of argumentation to classroom practice, and found designing argumentation questions to be challenging. Finally, elementary teachers connected argumentation to other disciplines whereas high school teachers focused more on the science content. These challenges and differences between teachers should be considered in the design of future professional development and preservice teacher education. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"McNeill, K.L.; Lynch School of Education, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, 02467, United States; email: kmcneill@bc.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Grounded in sociocultural theoretical frameworks, we consider learning to be a social, cultural practice, with understandings as co-constructed between participants through talk and in interactions. With these underpinning frameworks, we have explored water activities in kindergarten and examined how children and teachers collaboratively constructed science investigations to explore questions as they emerged from open-ended activities. The analysis revealed how children's investigations were mediated by their own speculations and explanations. Our primary claim herein is that children's questions, speculations, and insights were used collaboratively by teachers and children, and as such, became a structure in this classroom that supported children in taking agency. In this process, science curricula and working theories on science phenomena were generated. This was facilitated by teachers' openness to emergent approaches for their science curriculum. Through a discussion of these claims, an emphasis is placed on the value of students being positioned as co-constructors of science curricula. Furthermore, the integral role of the teacher in emergent curricula is introduced and developed as critical for being responsive to students' interests and insights. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Siry, C.; University of Luxembourg, Route de Diekirch, L-7220 Walferdange, Luxembourg; email: christina.siry@uni.lu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

But few studies consider what students ""take away"" from this type of instruction, i.e., how strategies developed in such curricula transfer into other contexts. Our research addresses this gap by examining how strategies cultivated in a yearlong chemistry curriculum (the originating context) appeared (absent teacher intervention) in a new context with new peers. Dependent upon Lobato's actor-oriented transfer perspective (2006), this mixed-methods study deploys a multilevel analysis of video data collected in six physics classrooms (the new context) during a researcher-designed activity. Results show that absent teacher directives, two classes partially attempted to frame the physics inquiry using strategies cultivated in the original context, and one fully framed the new context using these strategies. This class's successful use of a specific focusing phenomenon (electing student managers) appeared as the key component in this full framing. Significantly, we found that a carefully designed inquiry curriculum can support students' capacity to (a) organize to work collaboratively, (b) communicate to engage all students in the inquiry investigation, and (c) conduct scientific work that meets disciplinary requirements. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Patchen, T.; Department of Elementary and Bilingual Education, California State University, Fullerton, CA, 92834, United States; email: tpatchen@fullerton.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Fifty-five undergraduates experienced instruction on six key evolution concepts (adaptation, variation, inheritance, speciation, domestication, and extinction). Instruction enhanced with the TTES model was compared to a conceptual change intervention, using refutation text and discussion. Outcomes were assessed using the Evolutionary Reasoning Scale (Shtulman, 2006), the Transformative Experience Survey (Pugh, Linnenbrink-Garcia, Koskey, Stewart, & Manzey, 2010a), and the Evolution Emotions Survey.

Four teachers were recorded while teaching genetics. The empirical data consist of 45 recorded lessons. The teachers' verbal communications were analyzed using a linguistic framework called thematic pattern analysis. The results showed a predominant use of the word anlag over gene, whereas there was a total lack of use of the word allele. The word anlag was used to mean both gene and trait. Anlag was also used as a synonym for allele. The teachers' language conveyed four categories of meanings regarding the gene-to-trait relationship: genes control traits, are identified by traits, have traits, or are traits. This study thus highlights several linguistic challenges in the teaching of Mendelian genetics that might affect students' learning.

The participants included 835 fourth-grade students and 416 11th-grade students from four elementary schools and one high school in the United States. Students in treatment groups were asked to write three letters for exchange at the beginning/during/completion of an 8-week teaching unit about force and motion. The structure of writing was based on three components of arguments: question, claim, and evidence. A comparison of the pre- and posttest results indicated that students who engaged in collaborative letter-writing tasks performed better than students who did not. The pre- and posttest results also showed that female, special, low socioeconomic status, and gifted students benefited the most from the collaborative letter-writing tasks. Through the letter-writing exchange activities, the fourth-grade students were supported and encouraged to learn difficult concepts by the 11th-grade students. The more the 11th graders asked the fourth graders for explanation and clarification of the concepts in the letters, the more the fourth-grade students learned. Two factors related to argumentative writing were identified as predictors of success on students' achievement tests: overall cohesiveness, with an emphasis on embedding multiple modal representations in the text and the strength of the relationship between claims and evidence. This study suggests that there is a pedagogical need to build support structures to help students understand the role of audience, the function of multiple modal representations, and the quality of evidence for supporting knowledge claims in argumentative writing, as this could lead to a better understanding of scientific concepts. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Chen, Y.-C.; STEM Education Center, University of Minnesota, 320 Learning and Environmental Sciences, St. Paul, MN 55108, United States; email: chen2719@umn.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Five main conceptualizations are found to have existed over time, with different definition of scientific behavior and explanations to the relationship between knowledge and behavior. The frameworks have moved toward more elaborated explanations of the science domain, providing assessors with better support for operationalizing learning objectives. Currently, the assessments are faced with a challenge of adapting to the ""practice turn"" in science studies and learning science and thereby accounting for scientific behavior as a community practice. The paper concludes with suggestions for how frameworks may be improved to achieve this aim. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Kind, P.M.; School of Education, Durham University, Durham DH1 1TA, United Kingdom; email: p.m.kind@durham.ac.uk",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

The method, called transactional argumentation analysis, combines a transactional perspective on meaning making based on John Dewey's pragmatic philosophy and an argument analysis based on Toulmin's argument pattern. This analytical method consists of three steps. In the first step, we analyze the direction of the students' meaning making, that is, the relations construed in and by action. In the second step, we use a functional interpretation of Toulmin's argument pattern to clarify the meanings in terms of argumentative elements. Finally, we investigate the students' learning progress, both in terms of the way the arguments are constructed and the knowledge content used, by comparing each student's arguments over time. The empirical material consists of a video-recorded lesson in a Swedish upper secondary school. Two examples of learning processes identified during the classroom discussion are described: learning to specify the conditions for one's claim and learning to find new solutions. These examples show that the suggested method can be used to identify the different kinds of learning progressions that take place during students' argumentative discussions. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Rudsberg, K.; Department of Education, Uppsala University, SE-750 02 Uppsala, Sweden; email: karin.rudsberg@edu.uu.se",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In this study, the accountability practices of states were differentiated into three groups based on the degree to which science achievement contributed to accountability formulas. Data from National Assessment of Educational Progress Teacher Questionnaires were evaluated to assess the amount of time fourth-grade teachers devoted to mathematics and reading in 2003 and 2011, as well as to science in 2005 and 2009. Teachers from the three groups of states reported spending equivalent amounts of time on mathematics and reading. However, the frequency of teachers reporting spending at least 4 hours of weekly instructional time on science was significantly higher in states that integrated fourth-grade science achievement into accountability formulas versus states where science did not figure in high-stakes accountability.

In dispute the goal is to defend a conclusion by undermining alternatives, whereas in deliberation the goal is to arrive at a conclusion by contrasting alternatives. In this study, we examine the impact of these tasks goals on the quality of argumentative discourse. Sixty-five junior high school students were organized into dyads to discuss sources of energy. Dyads were formed by members who had differing viewpoints and were distributed to one of two conditions: 31 dyads were asked to discuss with the goal to persuade the partner, and 34 were asked to reach consensus. Argumentation was analyzed using a schema based on Toulmin (1958). Eleven different argumentative structures resulted from the combination of Toulmin's basic elements. Students in the consensus group scored significantly higher than students in the persuasion group in 5/6 argumentative structures that included rebuttals. The major implication of the present work is that, similar to Mercer's (2000) claim about types of classroom conversation, not all classroom argumentation tasks promote scientific reasoning equally. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..",,,,,,,"Garcia-Mila, M.; Department of Developmental and Educational Psychology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, 08035, Spain; email: mgarciamila@ub.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

An expectancy-value perspective is adopted to describe the motivations and expectations behind the respondents' physics choice. Three choice profiles were identified among secondary students. The intrinsic and extrinsic profile, broadly motivated by interest-enjoyment, expectation of success, and utility for university admission; the extrinsic profile emphasizing mainly utility; and the intrinsic profile emphasizing mainly interest-enjoyment. Females were underrepresented in the intrinsic profile. Many secondary students did not know what kind of job they wanted, but those who did, aspired to go into medicine (particularly females) or engineering (particularly males). Tertiary students were motivated by a passion for physics and high expectation of enjoyment, and many of them planned to go into research. Tertiary students were more likely than secondary students to value idealistic purposes in a future career. The results imply that participation in physics may be improved by targeting students with a broader motivation than interest alone, through inclusive classroom practices, support of students' self-concepts, and examples of physics applications and physics-related careers available. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Bøe, M.V.; Norwegian Centre for Science Education, Oslo, 0317, Norway; email: g.m.v.boe@naturfagsenteret.no",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Of particular importance is the question of whether or not children's early interests are instrumental in their later academic achievement. The current study fills this gap in the interest literature by longitudinally investigating the relationship between 116 children's early science interests and their subsequent self-concepts and science-related academic achievement, with particular emphasis placed on gender. The intensity and content of children's science interests between the ages of 4 and 6 (i.e., preschool interests) and between the ages of 6 and 8 (i.e., elementary school interests) were used as predictors of age 8 self-concept and science achievement. Boys displayed higher overall levels of science interests than girls, though interest was not related to boys' self-concepts. Girls' early intense science interests were related to higher science self-concepts at age 8. In addition, early interests predicted science achievement in girls but not in boys. In conclusion, it appears that early science interest may be a critical supporting factor for girls in fostering positive self-concepts and higher science achievement scores. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Qualitative analysis, drawing-sorting exercises, and hierarchical cluster analysis are used to answer two related questions: Are there categorical differences in drawings of participants; and if differences exist, can they be objectively recognized as measures of research experience? The analysis strongly suggests that (1) a willingness/ability to hybridize extant brain cell knowledge with imaginative conjecture grounded by experience of experimental plausibility gives rise to drawings that are recognized as being ""expert signatures"" by all classes of participants; (2) the drawings of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers' are influenced by a more mechanical observation style where faithfulness to actual observation work is prioritized; and (3) while a subset of undergraduates recognize the images of ""experts,"" their own drawings are invariably textbook reproductions. Nevertheless, teaching interventions designed to engender a research perspective free-up undergraduates' creative drawing potential so that sometimes their postintervention drawings are indistinguishable from those of principal investigators.

This paper explores the generation of science-related pedagogy as preservice primary teachers learn about the traditionally challenging subject of forces as part of their institution-based science education course. Findings illustrate how critical interpretation of the school curriculum is informed as a consequence of preservice teachers developing metacognitive awareness of their own learning of science. A subject matter learning audit provides a framework to enable the teachers to analyze their learning and apply their perspectives to the primary curriculum through focusing attention on the abstract and counterintuitive nature of forces. Pedagogic insight emerges as the student-teachers craft successive reflective accounts of their own understanding of forces and interpret the curriculum relating to forces. In doing so, they begin to translate their learning as pedagogical apparatus for their future work with pupils.

The teachers' framing of the lessons and the moves the teachers made during the discussions seemed to reinforce the limited nature of the students' responses. Furthermore, we found that teachers rarely used probing questions or tossed back students' ideas.

Participants' reasoning practices and understanding of multivariable causality were examined using semistructured interviews and recordings of their computer activities. Analyses show that participants with high expertise tended to take a mechanism approach to predict and identify relationships, focused more on multivariable relationships, and purposefully selected and tested variables. The findings also indicate that understanding about multiple causality involved recognition and identification of the integration rules of multiple effects and the attributes of variables (e.g., interactive and reciprocal) and relationships (e.g., direction and feedback loop). Additionally, this study suggests an interaction between participants' reasoning practices and their understanding of multivariable causality; participants' understanding about the integration rules and the attributes could initiate reasoning practices, and by the enactment of practices, the rules and attributes were confirmed and examined.

And what specific forms of family support are associated with doctoral students or scientists who report family as a primary source of initial interest in science? The study uses survey data from Project Crossover (n = 4,285), a sequential mixed methods study that examines factors influencing entrance into physical science doctoral programs as well as the transition from graduate students to independent researcher.

Further analyses show that family influence shifts from parental occupation as the primary source of interest for the older generation of scientists to one of three influences (occupation, diversion or hobby, and encouragement) among doctoral students. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Dabney, K.P.; Department of Teaching and Learning, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, 23284-2012, United States; email: kdabney@vcu.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

However, little research has been conducted to investigate elementary teachers' learning to promote students' sensemaking in elementary (K-5) classrooms. The purpose of this multiple-case study is to explore how preservice elementary teachers conceptualize and foster students' construction of evidence-based explanations. Our findings show that when the preservice teachers had difficulty conceptualizing their ideas about explanation construction, they were also challenged to support students' explanations constructed in the classroom. They frequently accepted evidence as a complete explanation and afforded their students opportunities to describe evidence rather than formulate evidence-based claims. Furthermore, each of the preservice teachers articulated rich and varied conceptions of ways to elicit students' prior knowledge and scaffold new knowledge construction that were not evident in their enactments in the classroom. These findings, which complement and extend those of other studies focused on in-service elementary teachers, suggest that a lack of emphasis on sensemaking components of scientific practice could be an endemic issue across the teacher professional continuum for which elementary teachers require ongoing and multifaceted forms of support. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Zangori, L.; Department of Teaching and Learning, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242-1529, United States; email: laura-zangori@uiowa.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In this paper, Taiwanese high school students' conceptions of science assessment and the relationship between their conceptions of science assessment and of science learning were investigated. The study used both qualitative and quantitative methods. First, 60 students were interviewed regarding their conceptions of science assessment. From these interviews, a survey was developed, validated, and used with 914 students to quantitatively examine the same question. Third, 224 students were surveyed to determine the relationship between their conceptions of both science assessment and science learning. Using the phenomenographic method, the first study revealed six categories of conceptions of science assessment: reproducing knowledge, rehearsing, accountability to learning, improving learning, problem solving, and critical judgment, which seem to reveal the surface, summative, and formative purposes of assessment, respectively. The second study, based on what the high school students reported about science assessment, resulted in the use of the Conceptions of Science Assessment questionnaire, which confirmed the second-order analysis (surface, summative, and formative) of the purposes of science assessment. In the third study, the relationships between high school students' conceptions of science assessment and of learning science were revealed. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Lee, M.-H.; Center for Teacher Education, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; email: leemh@mail.nsysu.edu.tw",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

A phenomenological approach was used to illuminate the experiences of the students. The results provide evidence that the students were in the role of apprentices, although this was not made explicit. As apprentices they learned by doing as legitimate peripheral participants in the groups. Mentoring was distributed among the group, with more advanced students providing much of it. The groups were both communities of practice and epistemic communities in which students gained methodological and intellectual proficiency. Finally, student learning in research groups can be conceptualized as learning trajectories that enter the group, traverse characteristics of communities of practice and epistemic communities, and leave with the students as novice researchers, proficient technicians, or knowledge producers. The implications for K-12 science education are that it is unrealistic to expect teachers to achieve the proficiency in traditional short-term research experiences that would prepare them to teach their students how to engage in authentic scientific research, and that these experiences should be structured so that the teachers are placed in tightly organized research groups with mentors who explicitly teach them how to do science. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Feldman, A.; College of Education, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, United States; email: afeldman@usf.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Extant studies on preservice and first-year teachers' NOS teaching practices have had disappointing results, with few teachers valuing NOS as a cognitive objective or teaching it in ways consistent with literature regarding effective NOS instruction. In addition, little is known about teachers' specific NOS practices due to a lack of observation protocols to assess teachers' NOS instruction. This study examined teachers' NOS instructional practices 2-5 years after completing an intensive secondary science education program that included a NOS course and attention to NOS instruction throughout all other science education coursework. Twelve of the 13 study participants explicitly taught NOS, and 9 of the 13 did so at moderate to high levels. This paper also presents a NOS Classroom Observation Protocol (NOS-COP) designed to make evident many facets of teachers' NOS implementation practices that have not always been clear in prior research.

The first is the need for, or development of, an environment that immerses teachers in discourse that allows, and actively supports, classroom practices that challenge the contemporary discourse. A key component of such discourse is an awareness of the emotional aspects of teaching. The second conclusion is the potential power of the mandated curriculum to legitimize, for teachers, discourses that challenge the contemporary discourse.

The conversations were examined by using practical epistemology analysis, which made it possible to follow students' meaning making in detail. The analysis revealed interactions between generic explanations of electrochemistry and the distinctions and correlations that were connected to particulars and contingencies of the galvanic cell. Consequences of these interactions amounted to becoming reminded of knowledge one had come across before, being able to connect distinctions of particular features of the cell to generalized chemical explanations, and realizing which aspects may be excluded from the account. The results indicate that learning in science needs to be approached more as a contingent process than as something that progresses along one particular dimension. They show how students appropriate the sociocultural tools of science and how they situate what they learn in both the particular features of the activity and in the relevant science.

This ethnographic study of a scientific lab investigating the absorption of light in the eyes of salmonid fish was designed to investigate the role of context in the understanding of data and graphs in science. Drawing on data from a 5-year ethnographic study of laboratory science, I exhibit the effort scientists mobilize to learn by reconstructing the context from which their data have been abstracted. Without recontextualization, scientists struggle making sense of the study results that emerge from their work. Scientists require familiarity with the settings from which the data derive and with the entire transformation process that produce graphical representations to be able to interpret the data.

The preservice teachers' course assignments, planned and enacted instructional sequences, and stimulated recall interviews were analyzed to characterize how their sense of obligations as students in a university science methods course and as student teachers in their school field-placement classrooms enabled and constrained their use of the instructional model. Findings show that the preservice teachers encountered multiple Discourses across communities. These Discourses shaped the obligations that preservice teachers were expected to fulfill.

His notion of ""embodied,"" ""objectified,"" and ""institutionalized"" cultural capital is used as a theoretical lens to identify both the intrinsic value of scientific knowledge and its extrinsic value for future employment. This analysis suggests that science education misses three opportunities to establish its value to its students and the wider public. First, science education commonly has a poor understanding of the nature of embodied capital that it offers, failing to communicate the cultural achievement that science represents. Second, it fails to see itself as a means of developing the critical dispositions of mind, which are the hallmark of a scientist but also useful to all citizens. Third, given the policy emphasis on educating the next generation of scientists, it fails to exploit the one major element of cultural capital that science education is currently seen to offer by scientists, the public, and its students-that is the value that science qualifications have for future employment. Bourdieu's concept that the primary function of education is to sustain the culture and privilege of the dominant groups in society offers a lens that helps to identify how and why these apparent contradictions exist.

This study reports on the co-construction of modeling practice and ecological knowledge by following the development of one seminal disciplinary concept, plant reproduction, through third graders' yearlong investigation of a wild backyard area. Representational activity facilitated the visibility and utility of meanings for reproduction; these meanings, in turn, shaped students' subsequent modeling practice. Over time, shifts were evident in both the community's meanings for reproduction and their framing of meanings in relation to modeling activity. The analysis affirms the utility of attending to student knowledge as it is used in practice to navigate complexity and uncertainty, rather than as assimilation of declarative statements. It also provides images of productive relations between modeling and knowledge, with implications for how the two might bootstrap each other in extended classroom investigation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Manz, E.; Department of Teaching and Learning, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37203-5721, United States; email: eve.i.manz@vanderbilt.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Using a feminist poststructuralist theoretical lens, this paper explores the identity work undertaken by the minority of girls who do identify with science and who express science aspirations at this age. It is argued that dominant associations of science with ""cleverness"" and masculinity pressurize girls to balance their science aspirations with performances of popular heterofemininity to render them ""thinkable"" (and that this occurs only within narrow parameters, through identity performances as either ""feminine scientists"" or ""bluestocking scientists""). The paper concludes by discussing potential challenges girls may face in sustaining ""thinkable"" identifications with science and wider implications for encouraging greater female participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Archer, L.; Department of Education and Professional Studies, King's College London, London SE1 9NH, United Kingdom; email: louise.archer@kcl.ac.uk",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

To build a bridge between students' everyday knowledge and scientific concepts, the role of metaphors and analogies came into the focus of the science education community during the past two decades. Approaches using metaphor-based teaching strategies often regard metaphors and analogies as teaching tools that can be adopted by a teacher. On the basis of the theoretical framework of experientialism, we argue that not only teaching but also thinking about and understanding science without metaphors and analogies is not possible. An analysis of studies dealing with metaphors and analogies in science education shows that instructional analogies and metaphors are often not understood as intended or not used by students in their own explanations. By reanalyzing 199 instructional metaphors and analogies on the basis of a metaphor analysis, we show that it takes more than making a connection to everyday life to communicate science fruitfully. We show that good instructional metaphors and analogies need embodied sources. These embodied sources are everyday experiences conceptualized in, for example, schemata such as containers, paths, balances, and up and down. For the analysis, we introduce the concept of conceptual metaphors for analyzing metaphors as well as analogies. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Niebert, K.; Institute for Science Education, Leibniz Universität Hannover, 30167 Hannover, Germany; email: niebert@idn.uni-hannover.de",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Five different orientations to student ideas are described in the findings. These include viewing student ideas as evidence of content coverage, as obstacles to understanding, as tools to prime students thinking, interest, and activity, as elements of a positive classroom environment, and as the raw material of learning.

Using the framework of conceptual metaphor, this paper sought to identify explicit and implicit metaphors in pedagogical texts dealing with the concept of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, an abstract and challenging domain for learners. Three university-level textbooks were analyzed from a conceptual metaphor perspective, and a range of explicit and implicit metaphors were identified. Explicit metaphors identified include entropy as disorder, thermodynamics processes as movements along a path, and energetic exchange as financial transactions among others. Implicit metaphors include application and elaboration of the generic Location Event Structure metaphor, application of the Object Event Structure metaphor, and others. The similarities and differences between explicit and implicit metaphors found in the textbooks are also described. Two key pedagogical implications are discussed: that the selection of explicit instructional metaphors can be guided by consistency with implicit metaphors; and that the range of implicit metaphors found in pedagogical texts implies that a multiple instructional metaphor strategy is warranted.

To anchor our conversation about these issues, we describe the evolution, in design, and enactment, of a ""candidate core"" and a suite of tools that supported the approximation of equitable and rigorous pedagogy for several groups of beginning science teachers. Their struggles and successes in taking up ambitious practice informed not only our designs for a beginner's repertoire but also a system of tools and socioprofessional routines that could foster such teaching over time. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Windschitl, M.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, United States; email: mwind@u.washington.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Drawing upon semiotic theory, we examine explicit thematic patterns (semantic meaning relations among science concepts) as well as hidden social, nature of science (NOS), and epistemological meanings co-constructed and communicated by teachers and students. It was found that a kindergarten teacher's discussion was mostly unhedged and boosted (absolutely), with the use of hedges (may, might, could) limited to an unexpected encounter with an undeveloped egg toward the end of the lesson. In contrast, a fourth-grade teacher's discussion was predominantly hedged, with the use of boosters limited to isolated episodes concerning the nature of scientific inquiry and experimental variables. Unhedged and boosted communication led to the co-construction of an unproblematic or factual body of scientific knowledge (transitivity, circumstantial, and nominal meanings), whereas hedged communication produced a problematic or tentative body of scientific knowledge (logical and taxonomic meanings). It is emphasized that unproblematic knowledge communication may be paralleled by NOS miscommunication. We argue that teachers should be provided with professional development that can increase their awareness of the risk of NOS miscommunication. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Oliveira, A.W.; Educational Theory and Practice Department, State University of New York at Albany, Albany, NY 12222, United States; email: aoliveira@albany.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

We draw on the construct of framing from anthropology and sociolinguistics and identify clusters of behaviors that indicate that students may alternatively frame the interview as inquiry, an oral examination, or an expert interview. We present two examples of students shifting between frames during the course of individual interviews. By examining the surrounding interaction, we identify both conceptual and epistemological interviewer cues that facilitate and constrain frame shifts.

Specifically, after the implementation (i) most students spontaneously selected to apply the targeted optimization strategy and provided appropriate justifications for their decisions, (ii) there was a substantial reduction in the frequency of responses that either relied on noncompensatory approaches or synthesized the available information in a nonvalid manner, and (iii) there was an improvement in students' ability to elaborate reasoning flaws in given decision-making approaches.

To engage in SPAs and thus demonstrate abilities such as scientific inquiry, students must interact with various participants and communicate in a variety of ways. Using an analytical framework that draws on functional and interactional views of language, we analyzed video footage of one SPA, The World Down Under, enacted in three fifth-grade classrooms. The video analysis revealed a wide variety of language demands that students encountered during the SPA, including a range of participant structures (whole class, small group, and individual), communicative modes (interpreting language, presenting language, and engaging interpersonally), and 18 different texts. Moreover, the language demands differed by classroom. A closer look at two video episodes illustrated how this more expansive communicative context afforded two English Learners (ELs) with opportunities to navigate the language demands of the assessment. However, the same language demands could present challenges for ELs with lower levels of English proficiency. The findings contribute to science education by bringing attention to the nature and role of language in SPAs, which has only begun to be described in the literature. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Lyon, E.G.; Education Department, University of California-Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, United States; email: eglyon@asu.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In the journals, students describe their understanding of a topic, the development of that understanding, and how the topic connects to their lives. In the process, they are able to engage in reflection about several things. How the frequency and nature of those reflections relate to overall course outcomes, the content and quality of final exam essays on those topics, and student metacognition in problem solving are the basis of this paper. The following types of reflections were identified in the journals: action, prior knowledge, project ideas, text resources, classroom events, and monitoring of knowledge. A multiple linear regression analysis of the students' final course grade earned versus student grade point average (GPA), composite score on the ACT exam, the number of reflections made for each reflection type, and the total number of reflections made throughout all journals was used to determine the significance of the type of reflections made by students in relationship to their chemistry content understanding. The results indicate that students' prior GPA and their reflections on classroom events and their own knowledge correlate positively and significantly with a final course grade. However, student reflections on text resources have a negative and significant correlation with the final course grade. In addition, students' journal entries and final exam responses were coded for similarities in writing. The results indicate that those students who had strong similarities in writing for both their journal and final exam exhibited significantly stronger content understanding on the final exam essay.

Changes in students' achievement were modeled as discontinuities within a cusp catastrophe model, where working memory capacity was implemented as asymmetry and the degree of field dependence/independence and logical thinking as bifurcation parameters. Data from achievement scores of high school students in nonalgorithmic problem solving (chemical, organic-synthesis problems) were used and analyzed, using dynamic difference equations and statistical regression techniques. The dependent measure was the score difference in problems of varying demand from M = 3 to M = 8. The cusp catastrophe models proved superior (R 2 = .73-.84) to the pre-post linear counterpart (R 2 =.52-.66). The empirical evidence for the catastrophe effect supports the nonlinear model for the working memory overload hypothesis. The results add to research endeavors that built bridges between concepts of the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and problem solving in science education, and to IPM as well.

M. Bakhtin's (1981) notion of dialogism to articulate what it means to understand a scientific idea. In science, understanding an idea is both conceptual and epistemic and is exhibited by an ability to use it in explanation and argumentation. Some distillation of these activities implies that dialogic understanding of a scientific idea includes being able to use it to explain natural phenomena, being aware that it is one among a multiplicity of alternatives, and that the scientific idea is superior to alternatives based upon a scientific evaluation which involves relating it to evidence. This notion of dialogic understanding is related here to a scaffolding framework, which we argue characterizes one form of instructional support for framing content dialogically as part of explanation and argumentation. For illustration, the framework is applied to data from a high school evolutionary biology course. In contrast to the prevailing position that dialogic understanding should be supported through engaging in argumentation (i.e., actual dialogue), we entertain an additional possibility that dialogic understanding can be supported through dialogic framing. We also entertain the possibility that dialogic framing of content can provide initial support for student engagement in argumentation. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Ford, M.J.; Department of Instruction and Learning, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, United States; email: mjford@pitt.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

I found that the children's performances of self in the classroom were consistent with the ways they spoke about themselves in the interviews. I also found that the academic identities they constructed were different from their disciplinary identities, and these differing identities were consistent across analytic contexts. Moreover, the identities the children constructed in the interviews nuanced my understandings of what I observed in the classroom in significant ways. I argue that juxtaposing narrated and performed analytical contexts offers affordances for understanding academic and disciplinary identities constructions in school and science.

While risk is conceptualized within a number of different theoretical frameworks, the predominant model used in examination specifications is a utility model in which risk calculations are deemed to be objective through technical expert assessment and where the perceptions of individual actors can be corrected by appropriate rationalization of action and thought. However, research studies and other theories on risk suggest that a utility-based approach fails to take into account social, experiential, and cultural factors, which frame what is considered to be risky. Our research study with science and mathematics teachers deploys a microworld, ""Deborah's dilemma,'' which presents a decision-making process involving probabilistic estimates in which teachers construct their own personal models of risk. Teachers were recorded in dialogue while working through the microworld. Inductive coding of the dialogue and interactions with the microworld show that teachers' decisions on risk have a rational underpinning, but that use of data and information only becomes coherent and comprehensible within the explicated values of decision makers.

Bringing together the theory of gender essentialism and the biased self-concept thesis, we interpret the cross-national variation in the relationship between self-concept and occupational plans. To this end, we fit a series of random intercept regression models to country-specific and pooled data. In all countries, science-oriented girls prefer employment in biology, agriculture, or health (BAH), whereas boys favor careers in computing, engineering, or mathematics (CEM). Almost everywhere, boys have more confidence in their science ability than girls, even after science performance is taken into account. In advanced industrial countries the male-female gap in science self-concept is larger than the corresponding gap in developing or transforming societies. The male-female segregation of preferences for science careers is also stronger in advanced industrial countries. Nevertheless, nowhere are gender disparities in science self-assessment related to the gender segregation in preferences for BAH and CEM careers.

Results show that the preservice teachers demonstrated a range of strengths and weaknesses in applying their knowledge of science assessment, science curriculum materials, and instructional strategies for teaching science. This range was influenced, in part, by the presence of alternative ideas about science teaching, the extent to which the original curriculum materials aligned with reform-based standards and practices, and the presence of prompts to use criteria in their analyses.

This study investigated the relevant importance of various issues in 1628 Norwegian upper secondary students' choices of postcompulsory subject combinations: natural science and mathematics (henceforth Science) or languages, social science and economics (henceforth HumSoc). Questionnaire items based on the Eccles et al. model of achievement-related choices were grouped into six constructs by factor analysis: expectation of success, interest-enjoyment value, self-realization value, fit to personal beliefs value, utility value for university admission, and relative cost. Interest-enjoyment and fit to personal beliefs were somewhat less important to Science students than to HumSoc students, especially to girls taking Science. Utility value for university admission was much more important to Science than to HumSoc students, and more important to Science girls than to Science boys. Costs in terms of time and effort were much more important to HumSoc than to Science students. The findings indicate that students choose Science both for identity reasons, such as interests, self-realization and fit to personal beliefs, and for strategic utility reasons. Some of the students, especially the girls, appear to have placed more weight on utility than on their interests.

Findings from a confirmatory factor analysis supplemented with an analysis of students' responses revealed a strong relationship between the concepts of genetic inheritance and cell division and provided evidence of the nature of the difficulties that students have when trying to understand these concepts. Specifically, students were challenged to demonstrate an integrated understanding of the differences between mitosis and meiosis processes. Also some students struggled to explain the importance of these processes as they relate to passage of genetic information.

This integrative research review draws on Cooper's methodology (Cooper, 1982; Cooper & Hedges, 2009) to synthesize empirical findings on the relationship between science education and test-based accountability policies. Current accountability policy, particularly at the federal level, is intended to influence educators to more fully consider the needs of all students; however, research suggests that, under these policies, many research-based reform efforts in science become sidetracked, teacher practice becomes more fact based, science is taught less, teachers become less satisfied, and many students' needs are not met. Therefore, a clear understanding of educators' perceptions of the impacts of current test-based accountability policies should guide the development and implementation of the next generation of national science standards and subsequent large-scale assessments. By also delineating the limitations of the research into the perceived connections between test-based accountability and science education, this synthesis reveals further research to be done. Finally, this paper details what the reviewed research suggests for improvements to K-12 science education accountability policies. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Anderson, K.J.; School of Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, United States; email: kanderson8@wisc.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

ESS is complex and is based on the idea that the earth can be understood as a set of interacting natural and social systems. An analytic, metalevel framework is needed to understand the complexity. The framework specifies a set of metalevel essential ideas and analytic concepts that can be applied to understand the substantive structures of ESS-the essential ideas describe the general nature of earth systems, and the analytic concepts describe types of discipline-specific concepts such as the materials, processes, and variables of earth systems. An analysis for the phenomenon of carbon cycling is provided as an example. The framework allows one to determine whether what is to be taught is complete and coherent and can be used to conduct research and evaluations of curriculum, teachers' knowledge, and students' knowledge in a systematic manner.

This exploratory study interviewed 24 science teacher educators from economically developed parts of China about their conceptions of teaching NOS to prospective science teachers. Five key dimensions emerged from the data. This paper focuses on the dimension of value of teaching NOS. The values of teaching NOS as perceived by the educators fall into two types. The first type relates to values within the scope of science teaching, which consists of (i) enriching content to be taught in school science, (ii) transforming traditional science teaching methods, (iii) increasing interest in science teaching, and (iv) constituting a foundation of school science teaching. The second type goes beyond classroom teaching, which includes (i) enhancing individual well-being in daily life and work-related matter, (ii) enlightening Chinese traditional culture, and (iii) promoting national development. While some of these values share much similarity of those discussed in the Western literature on NOS research, some are distinctively different with a Chinese favor.

First, the teachers' beliefs about teaching initially shift to a contemporary focus while participating in their teacher preparation program, but ultimately return to a didactic orientation by their first year in the classroom. At the same time, the teachers' beliefs about learning remain consistently more contemporary in nature. Finally, when the participants were enrolled in coursework with a field placement that emphasized reform-based teaching, their beliefs about teaching and learning were impacted in different ways based on the context of the placement and the individual.

Little research has been conducted on elementary students' epistemological beliefs specific to science education. This study offers insights into third-grade students' epistemological beliefs while paying attention to the intersection of epistemological beliefs with instructional context. To document epistemological beliefs, students were interviewed three times during the 5-month-long study. To document instructional context, class sessions associated with two science units (16 class sessions for each unit) were video/audio-taped. Students described investigation or testing as being central to science. Although they recognized investigation as a way to get information students tended not to distinguish the tests they did from ones they envisioned scientists doing. Furthermore, students suggested that particular tests are appropriate for particular purposes, a point that was reinforced by their own investigations. These findings suggest that it is important to consider what the activities in which students are engaged in the classroom communicate about the nature of scientific knowledge.

In particular, in some parts of the world, there has been considerable concern that students from particular religious backgrounds may reject some science teaching if perceived as inconsistent with their faith commitments. In this paper, we report the findings from an interview study that investigated how 12 13-14-year-olds from four diverse English schools perceived the relationship between science and religion. In particular, we consider how these students responded to any perceived contradiction and conflict between science and religion. We found a spectrum of stances among this small sample of secondary students. The more extreme positions represented a choice for either science or religion when conflict was perceived. However, other stances were found that sought a synthesis, accommodated inconsistent frameworks, or considered science and religion as noninteracting domains. These alternative stances present a similar range of possibilities to the possible outcomes that have been discussed when students' informal ideas in science are inconsistent with formal science teaching. The implications for further research and for curriculum development and teaching are considered. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Taber, K.S.; Science Education Centre, Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 8PQ, United Kingdom; email: kst24@cam.ac.uk",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Thus far, few other studies have investigated how preservice elementary teachers adapt science curriculum materials to better reflect five essential features of inquiry-based teaching and learning articulated in contemporary science education reform. Findings from previous research suggest that preservice elementary teachers can productively adapt science curriculum materials to make them more inquiry-based. The mixed-methods study presented here extends these findings by illustrating the essential features of inquiry preservice teachers emphasize in their curricular adaptations and the specific types of adaptations the preservice teachers make. Results suggest that the preservice teachers consistently attended to all five essential features of inquiry in their curricular adaptations. The types of adaptations that they made to promote each of these features of inquiry provide insight into their curriculum design practices and learning about science as inquiry that can serve as important leverage points for teacher education experiences and curriculum materials designed to support elementary teachers' science teaching practice and learning. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Forbes, C.T.; College of Education, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242-1529, United States; email: cory-forbes@uiowa.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

While traditional energy instruction often focuses on simple calculations of energy in idealized systems, we developed a new middle school energy unit that focuses qualitatively on the energy transformations that occur in everyday, nonidealized, systems. In this article, we describe our approach to energy instruction and report the effects this approach had on students' energy conceptions, ability to perform on distal criterion-referenced assessments, and preparation for future energy-related learning. Results indicate that during instruction, students' energy conceptions progress from a set of disconnected ideas toward an integrated understanding that is organized around the principle of transformation, and that these more integrated conceptions both boost students' ability to make sense of everyday phenomena and lay the groundwork for more efficient and meaningful energy-related learning in the future. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Nordine, J.; Department of Education, Trinity University, One Trinity Place, San Antonio, TX 78257, United States; email: jnordine@trinity.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Although supported among many educators worldwide, there is much confusion surrounding the STSE slogan. Widely differing discourses on STSE education and diverse ways of practicing, have led to an array of distinct pedagogical approaches, programs, and methods. We are left wondering how we might orient ourselves amid such a diversity of propositions. What does STSE look like in practice? What ideological orientations underpin its practice? In this paper, we review the research literature and educational practices in STSE education to (1) map out a typology of STSE education in the form of currents and (2) provide a heuristic that educators can use for critical analysis of discourses and practices in the field. We identify, explore, and critique six currents in STSE education: application/design, historical, logical reasoning, value-centered, sociocultural, and socio-ecojustice currents. We suggest that these currents may serve as a didactic tool for others, a framework that will assist educators in informing their own theoretical understandings, choices, and practices in the context of STSE education. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Pedretti, E.; Department of Curriculum, Teaching and Learning, OISE, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5S 1V6, Canada; email: erminia.pedretti@utoronto.ca",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

While scientific explanation receives significant emphases in these documents, there is little discussion or consensus within the science education community about the nature of explanation itself. However, debates about scientific explanation have been a mainstay for philosophers of science for decades. We argue that a more clearly articulated conceptualization of scientific explanation for science education is necessary for making the vision of science education reform a reality. In this essay, we use major philosophical theories of scientific explanation as lenses to examine how the science education community has constructed the idea of explanation. We also examine instructional practice in school science settings, including our own classrooms, where teachers and students are working to explain natural phenomena. Using these examples, we offer suggestions for preparing both educators and young learners to engage in explanatory discourses that are reasonably accountable to authentic epistemic practice in science. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Braaten, M.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706-1795, United States; email: mbraaten@uw.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Two modes of the model were compared in a between-groups pre- and posttest design. In both modes, users could move and rotate virtual 3D representations of the chemical structures of the two molecules, a protein and a small ligand molecule. In addition, in a haptic mode users could feel the interactions (repulsive and attractive) between molecules as forces with a haptic device. Twenty postgraduate students (10 in each condition) took pretests about the process of protein--ligand recognition before exploring the model in ways suggested by structured worksheets and then completing a posttest. Analysis addressed quantitative learning outcomes and more qualitatively students' reasoning during the learning phase. Results showed that the haptic system helped students learn more about the process of protein-ligand recognition and changed the way they reasoned about molecules to include more force-based explanations.

Children (mean age 9.6 years) and parents visited Explore Evolution, which conveyed current research about the evolution of seven organisms. Families were engaged with the exhibit, staying an average of 44 minutes. Parents' and children's explanatory, nonexplanatory, and evolutionary conversation was coded. Overall, substantive explanatory conversation occurred in 65% of parent utterances, whereas nonexplanatory conversation occurred in 21% of the utterances. We found substantial use of exhibit text by parents (12.9% of utterances) who read it aloud and reframed the text for their children. Parents also used evolutionary terms and evolutionary concepts (10.2%), showing that such an exhibit is a valuable way to introduce this difficult topic to elementary-school-aged children. Parents' use of explanatory conversation positively related to their children's use of explanatory and evolutionary conversation, indicating that a dialogic interchange was occurring. Parents' attitudes toward the exhibit content, particularly the issue of human evolution, related to the museum experience.

Follow-up interviews with participants reinforced the importance of these elements. While accountability measures were found to have a significant impact on science teaching, participants were also able to use their PLC-based experiences to develop strategies to deal with such external constraints.

A total of 177 college students (60% science and 40% non-science majors) completed a SEVs survey and a decision-making instrument. The decision-making instrument contains expository text introducing the environmental management issue of an invasive species, and a series of open-ended questions to elicit participants' reasons and judgments on the issue. Analyses revealed that tentativeness and creativity of SEVs are the significant components directly manifested in the socioscientific decision-making process. Students who held changing and tentative beliefs about scientific knowledge were more likely to recognize the complexity, take multiple perspectives, and question omniscient authority in the decision-making process. It was also found that over one-half of the college students, especially those who were science majors, make decisions based on a single disciplinary perspective.

Participants were undergraduate junior and senior students who were enrolled in an earth science education course offered for preservice secondary science teachers at a university in Korea. The undergraduate students conducted, as a course activity, earth scientific inquiry according to the Abductive Inquiry Model (AIM) to explain a typhoon's anomalous path. Data sources included students' presentation materials, written reports, and interviews with five selected participants. The data were analyzed qualitatively in collaboration with a practicing earth scientist. The findings of the study revealed the characteristics of students' inquiry performance in each phase of the AIM. During the exploration phase, the students investigated earth scientific phenomena with provided data and transformed the data into new forms to discover problems to be explained abductively. In the examination phase, the students activated and expanded their background knowledge to find appropriate rules for abductive inference. Furthermore, they created new rules, which contained hypothetical explanations for the phenomena in question. The selection phase provided the students with opportunities to evaluate their hypotheses with empirical and theoretical criteria and choose more plausible ones. Finally, in the explanation phase, the students provided genetic and narrative explanations using the hypotheses selected previously. Implications for science inquiry learning as well as relevant research were suggested. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Oh, P.S.; Department of Science Education, Gyeongin National University of Education, Anyang, Gyeonggi, 430-040, South Korea; email: philoh@ginue.ac.kr",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Moreover, ordinal-level attitudinal data are routinely analyzed as if these data are equal interval, thereby violating requirements of parametric tests.

It also highlights an ontological and epistemological consideration of these views, particularly the ways through which Egyptian Muslim teachers understand such a relationship with reference to the Qur'anic/Islamic attitude toward science and knowledge. The study built upon Barbour's categorization scheme to guide the data collection and analysis and to guide the interpretation of the teachers' responses in the interviews. Informed by a multigrounded theory of the teachers' views of science and religion, and using Roth and Alexander's analytical framework to interpret how teachers accommodate the relationship between science and religion within their belief system, the findings suggest that participants' views of the relationship between science and a specific religion (Islam) confirmed the centrality of teachers' personal religious beliefs to their own thoughts and views concerning issues of both science and Islam. This centralization, in some cases, appeared to lead teachers to hold a conflicting relationship, hence to a creation of a false contradiction between science and Islam. Therefore, it could be concluded that teachers' personal Islamic-religious beliefs inform their beliefs about the nature of science and its purpose. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Mansour, N.; Graduate School of Education, University of Exeter, St. Luke's Campus, Exeter EX1 2LU, United Kingdom; email: n.mansour@ex.ac.uk",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

To bring clarity to the literature, we propose defining science teaching orientations as a set of beliefs with the following dimensions: goals and purposes of science teaching, views of science, and beliefs about science teaching and learning.

Although the role of museums in stimulating interest among students has been acknowledged for some time, empirical evidence about how the specific variable of a museum setting might trigger situational interest is almost nonexistent. The present study was conducted as a case study to provide an inductive, explorative investigation of how situational interest emerged during the field trip. A situative approach to the study of interest was applied in the form of a combined analytical tool that captures both social and psychological aspects. Qualitative methods were used to generate data: observation, video recording, and interviews. The findings showed that the aquarium visit triggered a lot of situational interest among the students and led to positive emotions toward the topic. Five situational variables were found to trigger the students' interest: social involvement, hands-on, surprise, novelty, and knowledge acquisition. The situational variables are largely under the control of the teacher and/or museum staff and should be considered when planning museum visits. This study suggests that teachers can find ways to foster students' involvement in specific content areas and increase levels of academic motivation regardless of prior interest. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Bonderup Dohn, N.; Department of Curriculum Research, The Danish School of Education, University of Aarhus, Tuborgvej 164, Copenhagen NV DK-2400, Denmark; email: nibd@dpu.dk",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

A comparison class enrolled in the same course with the same instructor underwent the identical experience except that matching of concept and method was reversed. Multiple assessments over time showed superior mastery of the concept learned via PBL for both groups. In Study 2, using a subtractive method, we further investigated the role of specific components of the PBL method by comparing a group who worked individually using a PBL method to one who participated in the typical collaborative form of PBL.

Much remains to be understood regarding the sources, nature, and development of teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in regard to NOS. Using S. Magnusson, J. Krajcik, and H.

We relied on interviews, questionnaires, classroom observations, and classroom artifacts collected over a 3 year period to characterize their PCK for NOS. Although each had robust knowledge of instructional strategies for teaching NOS, teachers lacked the requisite knowledge of assessment that would provide a feedback loop to support continued development of their knowledge of learners and lead to improvement in their teaching of NOS.

In addition to finding that learning about HIV/AIDS happens across seven contexts of students' lives in diverse ways, including and beyond school settings, this study finds that students integrate learning that happens in these different contexts to shape their understandings and perspectives on HIV/AIDS issues. These findings are used to discuss the place of school learning within students' thinking about HIV/AIDS, highlighting ways in which students both value and discount their school learning in relation to other sources of learning.

The very nature of some scientific domains contributes to the learning difficulties students' experience. Phenomena in these domains are composed of multiple organization levels featuring complicated interactions within and across these levels. Molecular genetics is a compelling example of such a domain. Current instructional practices in genetics leave students ill prepared to benefit from technological advances in genetics or to participate in public discussions about genetic issues. We argue that instruction in genetics needs to be refocused such that it promotes generative understandings of the genetic mechanisms that are at the core of modern genetics. This paper presents the early stages of design-based research involving the development and study of a curriculum unit in genetics for high school students. We employed several design strategies to make the structure and mechanisms of genetic phenomena salient in the activities of the unit. Our findings suggest that the curriculum does, to a large extent, engender a deeper understanding of genetic phenomena. Specifically, we observed gains in students' understanding of the genetic information and the mechanisms that link genes to traits. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Duncan, R.G.; The Graduate School of Education, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, United States; email: ravit.duncan@gse.rutgers.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In particular, the identification of shortcut reasoning procedures (heuristics) used by students to reduce cognitive load can help us devise strategies to foster the development of more analytical ways of thinking. The central goal of this study was thus to investigate the reasoning heuristics used by undergraduate chemistry students when solving a traditional academic task (ranking chemical substances based on the relative value of a physical or chemical property). For this purpose, a mixed-methods research study was completed based on quantitative results collected using a ranking-task questionnaire and qualitative data gathered through semistructured interviews. Our results revealed that many study participants relied frequently on one or more of the following heuristics to make their decisions: recognition, representativeness, one-reason decision making, and arbitrary trend. These heuristics allowed students to generate answers in the absence of requisite knowledge; unfortunately, they often led students astray. Our results suggest the need to create more opportunities for college chemistry students to monitor their thinking, develop and apply analytical ways of reasoning, and evaluate the effectiveness of shortcut reasoning procedures in different contexts. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Talanquer, V.; Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States; email: vicente@u.arizona.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In the Footprints Puzzle, students are challenged to distinguish observations from inferences to learn about the nature of science or the culture of science. Oregon's Inquiry Scoring Guide separates content knowledge from inquiry skills. Given long-standing discredit of ""the"" scientific method, modern views emphasize the diversity of inquiry methods and explanatory ideals across disciplines. Paleontologists, for example, reconstruct the behavior of extinct beasts from fossil footprints using methods of inquiry responsive to this aim. Figuring out dinosaur locomotion depends upon making analogies to the limb structure and behavior of extant species. The history of the Footprints Puzzle demonstrates that an enduring adherence to ""a process approach"" obscures how conceptualization intertwines with methodology.

It has been suggested that the standard diagrams used to depict the earth's orbit may be in some way responsible for the initial appearance and overall maintenance of this incorrect conceptualization; the elongated shape of the orbit is thought of as a conceptualization cue that invites a fairly predictable way of reasoning. To test whether that is indeed the case, six variants of diagrams depicting differently shaped earth orbits around the sun were presented to 652 ninth-grade students in the United States. From responses to a written assessment, students' ideas about what caused the seasons were identified and analyzed. Elongation of orbit did not appear to have an effect, and there was no reinforcement effect for students who initially believed in an elongated orbit.

Our comparisons suggest that simplifying the instructional context may facilitate students in engaging in other aspects of argumentation in more complex ways. The instructional context may also be used as a tool to support students in argumentation in new content areas and to increase the complexity of their written arguments, which may be weaker than their oral arguments. Furthermore, classroom norms play an important role in supporting students of all ages, including elementary students, in argumentation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Berland, L.K.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, College of Education, University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712, United States; email: leema.berland@mail.utexas.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

To study the presentation of this phenomenon, we have reconstructed six essential, history and philosophy of science (HPS)-related aspects of the events that culminated in Einstein proposing his hypothesis of lightquanta and the ensuing controversy within the scientific community. These aspects are (1) Lenard's trigger hypothesis to explain the photoelectric effect, (2) Einstein's quantum hypothesis to explain the photoelectric effect, (3) lack of acceptance of Einstein's quantum hypothesis in the scientific community, (4) Millikan's experimental determination of the Einstein photoelectric equation and Planck's constant, h, (5) Millikan's presuppositions about the nature of light, and (6) the historical presentation and its interpretation within a history and philosophy of science perspective. Using these aspects as criteria, we analyzed 103 university general physics textbooks. Results obtained reveal that these historical elements are largely ignored or distorted in the textbooks, with only three of the texts obtaining a score of satisfactory and none a score of excellent. It is concluded that inclusion of HPS-related aspects in general physics textbooks can facilitate a better understanding of the dynamics associated with the initial controversy and final acceptance of Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect by the scientific community. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Niaz, M.; Epistemology of Science Group, Department of Chemistry, Universidad de Oriente, Apartado Postal 90, Cumaná, Estado Sucre 6101A, Venezuela; email: niazma@gmail.com",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Clinical interviews were conducted to probe 30 undergraduate physics students' mental models and their predictions about heat conduction. This study adopted a constant comparative method to discover patterns of the participants' responses across the various sources of data, such as verbal utterances, writings, and drawings. The results indicate that, based on the identified five process analogies for how heat is conducted and three ontological beliefs about the material basis for heat conduction, the combinations of these two aspects can better represent their mental models in terms of both the underlying mechanisms and emergent processes of heat conduction than using either alone as has sometimes been done in prior research. In addition, while a scientifically accepted mental model had a better chance to be accompanied by a correct prediction, a correct prediction might not result from a scientifically accepted mental model. However, as suggested by some cognitive psychologists, regardless of which mental models the participants possessed, they tended to automatically retrieve their learned rules or past experience, instead of manipulating their mental models, to generate predictions for the encountered problems. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Chiou, G.-L.; Graduate School of Technological and Vocational Education, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei 106, Taiwan; email: gc2158@columbia.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

We provided professional development to bolster urban teachers' science content knowledge (CK) and science pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) to observe the maximal impact of the PBS curriculum. We found that students' science achievement improved with the PBS curriculum, but that their attitudes toward science and plans to pursue science did not. Increases in teachers' CK and PCK with the professional development correlated with the improvements in student science achievement but did not correlate with improvements in student science attitudes or plans. However, the frequency of teachers' use of specific inquiry-based activities did correlate with improvements in students' science attitudes and plans.

Highlighted by a considerable body of research, one of the concerns is that young people still mobilize a naive conception of science. Consequently, we must pursue the reflection process concerning ways of renewing the school conception of science so as to propose ways of representing and doing that are a greater source of participation among students. In this article, we argue for the importance of enriching school discourses by mobilizing a socialized conception of science. Our perspective seeks to highlight the major theoretical contributions of ethnomethodology put forward by Bruno Latour. Hence, we propose an operational definition of the social construction of science based on actor-network theory as an attempt to produce a more focused conceptualization of science as a social enterprise. This theoretical work enables us to bring out various facets of the social construction of science that, in our view, should be accounted for in classes to renew the school image of science in line with the characteristics of contemporary technosciences in the making.

In this article, some of the questions discussed in this debate are elaborated in relation to meaning making in educational settings. The aim is to illustrate how an approach built on pragmatism and Wittgenstein's works makes it possible to take the role of both situation and experiences into account within a sociocultural perspective on learning. In video-recordings of second and fourth-fifth graders working in pairs meaning making is studied using practical epistemology analysis, i.e., what children talk about as relevant and what experiences they reactualize when answering questions. By analyzing the role of reactualization of experience, the role of reactualization and situation in making questions and problems intelligible, and the individuals' encounters with artifacts and the consequences of this in meaning making, we elucidate why it is important to consider meaning making in situ as an empirical question. It is concluded that the way questions are made intelligible will direct the meaning making and when using an artifact to answer questions, it is not the artifact in itself, but the specific use of the artifact that mediates action. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Lidar, M.; Department of Education, Uppsala University, SE-750 02 Uppsala, Sweden; email: malena.lidar@ped.uu.se",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

We examined participants' responses on four tactile investigations focused on concepts and processes associated with matter changes. The matter changes investigated were dissolution, chemical change, expansion, and condensation. Individual interview and model-making sessions comprised the primary data collection, whereas journal writing and focus group interviews provided additional, secondary data. Participants' responses during matter activities were analyzed by using three data frames: structural views of matter, types of understanding of matter changes, and conceptual consistency of students' explanatory schemes. Coding of the responses identified macro- (physically observable) and microparticulate (invisible) views of matter and both scientifically accurate and alternate understandings of matter changes coexisting within one response set. Data analysis led to the development of individual meandering mind maps as an analytical tool that illustrates the shifting of each participant's thinking between the macro- and microparticulate views of matter. A meandering mind map utilized in the study consists of a macroparticulate outer layer, microparticulate inner layer, and an interface layer that includes lynchpin concepts compound, molecule, atom, and element. The lynchpin concepts are perceived to mediate and scaffold cognitive shifts between the macroparticulate and the microparticulate views of matter. During individual interviews, each participant's responses were coded to one of the three categories, plotted in clockwise sequence and connected with a line. The findings include that congenitally blind participants hold (a) both macro- and microparticulate views of the nature of matter, (b) scientifically accepted and scientifically alternative understandings about matter concepts, and (c) conceptually inconsistent explanatory schemes of matter across the four data collection activities. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Smothers, S.M.; Alabama School for the Blind, Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind, Talladega, AL 35161, United States; email: sinikka7@hotmail.com",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Holding rich high school scientific discussions is challenging, especially when the demands of content and norms of high school science pose challenges to their enactment. There is little research on how high school teachers enact scientific discussions using project-based science curricula, making the kinds of necessary embedded supports unclear. To address that gap in the research literature, this study analyzed curriculum supports and embedded educative features for the enactment of science discussions in one high school project-based science curriculum. Through a study of teacher enactment and a comparison of the curriculum discussion supports, we observed that while teachers increased their attempts to engage in inquiry-based discussion practices where supports were offered, they relied on heavily on traditional ""recitation"" formats, demonstrating that existing curricular supports were not developed enough to support dialogic classroom interactions. We hypothesize about conditions that may contribute to the pervasiveness of typical discourse practices in high school science discussions. We argue for expanded curricular discussion supports for teachers and design research on developing discussions in high school project-based science classrooms to examine how such supports are taken up, dismissed, or modified in practice. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Alozie, N.M.; School of Education, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1259, United States; email: cinny@umich.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Data were analyzed using the Rasch partial credit model. Analyses concerning reliability and validity showed that the developed instrument provides an adequate measure of students' use of decision-making strategies. Analyses indicated that the test instrument can be used among different age groups and that decision-making competence increases with respect to years of education. Most elaborate strategies were characterized by the use of trade-offs, the ability to weigh decision criteria, and the ability to reflect on the structure of decision-making processes. In contrast, baselevel strategies were characterized by the use of cutoffs and an absence of elaborate metareflection.

However, there is also evidence that such responses underpredict the more sophisticated knowledge that teachers may use in classroom situations. The purpose of this study was to characterize the informal ideas used by teachers in situations directly relevant to their teaching of science. The sample comprised 50 Mexican primary school teachers. Three areas of informal expertise were addressed: scientists and their work; scientific inquiry; and data measurement. The teachers' thinking was explored through questionnaires and semistructured interviews using pedagogically relevant contexts. The database was analyzed first to describe ideas shared by teachers and second to identify any recurrent themes and patterns among responses. Teachers' responses were characterized around four areas of discourse: demarcation of science; scientific procedures; approaches to reliable knowledge; and professional and institutional features of science. The teachers' responses were diverse in their contextualization, that is, they incorporated specific background and contextual details to a different extent. Most responses showed limited or intermediate contextualization across all four areas of discourse, though some more sophisticated responses were noted. A general framework was developed to characterize this diversity in teachers' responses. This paper concludes with a discussion of the extent to which this sample of teachers was equipped to discuss the nature of science in pedagogical contexts and, given their starting points, how they might be supported in developing their expertise in doing this.

This paper describes an assessment system designed to elicit information from students at many placements along developmental trajectories and demonstrates how this system was used to gather principled evidence of how students reason about food web and food chain disturbances. Specifically, this assessment system was designed to gather information about students' intermediary or middle knowledge on a pathway toward more sophisticated understanding. Findings indicate that in association with a curricular intervention, student gains were significant. However, despite overall gains, some students still struggled to explain what might happen during a disturbance to an ecosystem. In addition, this paper discusses the importance of having a cognitive framework to guide task design and interpretation of evidence. This framework allowed for the gathering of detailed information, which provided insights into the intricacies of how students reason about scientific scenarios. In particular, this assessment system allowed for the illustration of multiple types of middle knowledge that students may possess, indicating that there are multiple "" messy middles"" students may move through as they develop the ability to reason about complex scientific situations. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Gotwals, A.W.; College of Education, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824-1034, United States; email: Gotwals@msu.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Our research focuses on the discourse in urban high school science classrooms in which the teachers used the same global climate change curriculum. We analyzed transcripts from three teachers' classrooms examining both the argument structure as well the dialogic interactions between students. Between 19% and 35% of the discourse focused on scientific argumentation in that students were using evidence and reasoning to justify their claims. Yet in terms of dialogic interactions, only one teacher's classroom was characterized by student-to-student interactions and students explicitly supporting or refuting the ideas presented by their peers. This teacher's use of open questions appeared to encourage students to construct and justify their claims using both their scientific and everyday knowledge. Furthermore, her explicit connections to previous students' comments appeared to encourage students to consider multiple views, reflect on their thinking and reflect on the thinking of their classmates. This study suggests that a teacher's use of open-ended questions may play a key role in supporting students in argumentation in terms of both providing evidence and reasoning for students' claims and encouraging dialogic interactions between students. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"McNeill, K.L.; Lynch School of Education, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467, United States; email: kmcneill@bc.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Qualitative analysis of data made visible the successes and struggles in using a K-12 induction program to promote equitable science and mathematics instruction.

In part, this is because to do so requires that teachers make real-time instructional decisions in response to the ideas that students articulate. In this paper I present an example of a teacher who participated in a series of activities during a professional development course that guided her and her colleagues through the process of developing and revising an explanatory model of magnetic phenomenon. She subsequently transformed this series of activities to use with her elementary school students. Contrasting the series of activities in the elementary classroom to the corresponding professional development activities revealed improvisational instructional acts and shed light on aspects of the classroom context that necessitated and facilitated improvisation.

Using the theoretical framework of communities of practice (E. Wenger, 1998), a better understanding of the challenges and successes of this collaboration is presented. In particular, the analysis suggests that participant engagement in both communities (school and aquarium) led to the development of an overlap in these communities of practice. This resulted when common forms of mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire emerged over the course of the project. Consistent with Wenger's framework, boundary objects and brokers could be identified that helped secure such overlap in this particular case.

The classroom discourse of a Grade 11 biology teacher was analyzed during the teaching of the concept chemosynthesis. Data were drawn from lesson transcripts, observational fieldnotes, and informal interviews with the teacher. The findings showed that the multimodal semiotics framework was useful at illustrating how semiotic and epistemological functions of modalities compounded meanings. Most significantly, an emergent multimodal framework relating semiotic functions and science learning outcomes emerged that has the potential to (1) act as a metacognitive tool for teachers to select, sequence, and scaffold modalities and (2) act as an analytical framework for educational researchers to analyze meaning making in science teaching and learning. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Jaipal, K.; Faculty of Education, Brock University, 500 Glenridge Road, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; email: kjaipal@brocku.ca",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Students are claimed to hold misconceptions and naïve beliefs, and the impact of teaching on their conceptions is also low. In the present study, these results are called into question, and it is argued that they may to a large extent be seen as artifacts of the research methods deployed, in particular when written questionnaires are used. When following students' project work in school over a long period, many of the misunderstandings reported in the literature do not appear. It is argued that the appropriation and use of scientific language when discussing complex socioscientific issues is a gradual process. When observing the language and mediational means students use over time, it is obvious that they are able to identify and use central distinctions in their interactions. They are also able to make productive use of texts and other materials that allow them to successively approximate scientific modes of reasoning. Thus, what students know emerges in communicative practices where they interact with others and with cultural tools in a focused activity.

Our investigation of the representation of students in the biological sciences indicates that gains in the percentages of non-Asian minorities in the biological sciences over almost two decades do not exceed their growth in the U.S. population and, furthermore, that their underrepresentation appears to increase as they move through higher education.We call for the development of multiple measures of representation in the sciences, given the complexities of representing representation and the issue's importance for science, public health, and the American polity. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Lewis, J.L.; Graduate School of Education, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, United States; email: jlewis@ucr.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

These teacher perceptions may be connected to classroom practices in terms of the extent to which standards are utilized by individual teachers. The purpose of this study was to identify how secondary science teachers characterize state science standards, modify their curricula on the basis of standards, and view the impacts of standards on students and teachers in their schools. Twenty-two science teachers from five purposefully selected school districts were interviewed using a protocol targeting attitudes toward standards and accountability, ways teachers use standards to develop and modify curricula, impacts of standards on students and teachers, and utilization of standards-based resources and professional development. An inductive approach was used to analyze data and produced both common views of science standards held by many teachers and profiles that characterize subgroups of teachers. Participants described both positive and negative aspects of standards-based accountability, and roughly half of the teachers described modifying their curricula according to standards. Teachers were categorized into six different profiles: negative perspectives, game of testing, already doing it part of the cycle, reality of teaching, and useful tools. Suggestions for different approaches to professional development are elaborated for teachers of these various profiles. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Donnelly, L.A.; Teaching Leadership and Curriculum Studies, Kent State University, 404 White Hall, Kent OH 44266, United States; email: ldonnell@kent.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In this paper, we empirically explore what more goes into giving a scientific account of a natural phenomenon than giving such generalized explanations. We audio-recorded pairs of upper secondary students during laboratory work in electrochemistry. We used a situative and pragmatist approach to study learning in action. This approach made it possible to study how the particulars and contingencies of working with a real electrochemical cell went into students' reasoning. Our results show that students needed to learn to make distinctions, recognize, and name the particulars in encounters with their cell. They also needed to learn what counts as reasonable readings and to deal with quantitative issues and correlations pertaining to their cell. We refer to these additional learning requirements as the students' taxonomic and measurement interests. Implications for what is involved in giving a scientific account of a natural phenomenon in school are discussed.

Often, what they have been prepared to do in teacher education programs is not aligned with what is expected at them in schools. As a consequence, many teachers leave the profession or move away from the reform-minded practice emphasized in their preparation as they accept the norms of their new community of practice. Using cultural historical activity theory, this comparative case study explored two beginning science teachers' transition into the teaching profession and the roles a community of practice played in this transition. Findings suggest that these science teachers were influenced by the social and professional structures at their schools and by the level of institutional and interpersonal support they received from peer teachers and administrators. The extent to which these teachers became involved in the community of practices at their schools greatly influenced their instructional practice. Implications suggest that science teacher preparation and induction programs must go beyond simply emphasizing teaching and learning-they must also address strategies young teachers can use to access the support they need to be able to consistently enact reform-based practices. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Saka, Y.; College of Arts and Science, Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL 32306, United States; email: yys3536@fsu.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In their neglect of policy studies, researchers have maintained an ongoing naivete about the politics of science education. In doing so, they often overestimate the implications of their research findings about practice and ignore the interplay between the stakeholders beyond and in-school who determine the nature of the curriculum for science education and its enacted character. Policies for education (and science education in particular) always involve authority and values, both of which raise sets of fascinating questions for research. The location of authority for science education differs across educational systems in ways that affect the role teachers are expected to play. Policies very often value some groups in society over others, as the long history of attempts to provide science for all students testifies. As research on teaching/learning science identifies pedagogies that have widespread effectiveness, the policy issue of mandating these becomes important. Illustrations of successful policy to practice suggest that establishing conditions that will facilitate the intended implementation is critically important. The responsibility of researchers for critiquing and establishing policy for improving the practice of science education is discussed, together with the role research associations could play if they are to claim their place as key stakeholders in science education. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Fensham, P.J.; School of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, Queensland University of Technology, Kelvin Grove, Brisbane 4059 Queensland, Australia; email: peter.fensham@education.monash.edu.au",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

With regard to the learning of science and socialization, we discuss and problematize these norms in the context of science learned at school and the nature of science. A methodological approach has been developed and used to analyze and identify the role that teachers' actions play in which epistemology students adopt in their meaning making and to highlight which view of science this usage represents. The approach consists of a combination of three methodologies: practical epistemology analyses, epistemological move analyses, and analyses of companion meanings. This combination produces communication analysis of companion meanings. The theory is based on pragmatism, sociocultural approaches to learning, and the later works of Wittgenstein. The companion meanings described in the empirical material indicate that if students learn the identified norms without any explicit problematization, they will only view science as rational and inductive in character and exclude alternative views from the practice. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Lundqvist, E.; Department of Education, Uppsala University, Uppsala 75002, Sweden; email: eva.lundqvist@ped.uu.se",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

There has been significant amount of attention to this mismatch in the science education research literature, primarily with respect to experimentation and argumentation as core disciplinary means of assessing ideas.

We highlight examples and research from the history and philosophy of science to clarify what scientists mean by ""mechanism"" and to make the case for its centrality. We then present an excerpt from a second-grade class in which a student provides an incorrect mechanistic explanation, and the teacher gives priority to textbook correctness.

To better understand the issues related to alignment, this study compares the alignment in physics among three education systems: Jiangsu (China), New York State (United States), and Singapore. The same coding framework for content standards and standardized tests is used to compute the alignment indices in the three education systems. It was found that there was a statistically significant alignment between the New York content standard and the standardized test for physics, but there was not a statistically significant alignment for Chinese and Singapore physics. The insignificant alignment for Chinese and Singapore physics was due to a shift toward higher level cognitive reasoning skills from content standards to standardized tests. For Chinese physics, the insignificant alignment was also due to a heavier emphasis on electricity in the test than in the content standard. Both significant and insignificant alignments may result in desirable and undesirable effects on guiding classroom instruction. Thus, ongoing study of the alignment between a science content standard and the standardized test is necessary for any education system, and alignment studies may be used as a means of teacher professional development for improving student achievement. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Liu, X.; The State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260, United States; email: xliu5@buffalo.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Interestingly, physics is also the field that suffers the greatest lack of females and has been criticized most for its androcentric culture. The gender bias in teacher ratings persists even when accounting for academic performance, classroom experiences, and family support. Furthermore, male and female teachers in each discipline appear equally effective at preparing their students for future science study in college, suggesting that students have a discipline-specific gender bias. Such a bias may negatively impact female students and contribute to the loss of females in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Potvin, G.; Department of Engineering and Science Education and Department of Mathematical Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634, United States; email: gpotvin@clemson.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Each of 20 parent-child dyads explored an interactive exhibit hall privately, without the distraction of other visitors. Parents employed a variety of strategies to support their children's understanding of unfamiliar topics, including describing evidence, giving direction, providing explanation, making connections, and eliciting predictions. Parents' education was associated with both the amount of time dyads spent exploring exhibits and the proportion of exhibits at which parents made connections to prior experiences. Parents' attitudes toward science were likewise associated with the proportion of exhibits visited. Parent-child dyads spent more time at exhibits that encouraged Active Prolonged Engagement (APE). Parents elicited predictions more often at APE exhibits, and children described evidence and gave direction more often at APE exhibits. Thus, both participant characteristics and exhibit qualities were found to contribute to parent-child interactions in an informal science setting. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Szechter, L.E.; Department of Psychology, Tulane University, Percival Stern Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118, United States; email: szechter@tulane.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Housed in the building sponsored by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, their exhibits depicted a wide range of scientific phenomena. They also represented the conflicting values of science educators and industrialists about the societal worth of science education. In some instances, students' projects and laboratory activities prized hands-on learning and aimed to abet widespread rational thinking for democratic citizenship, which reflected the civic priorities of Progressive science educators. In other cases, science was presented as a magical spectacle with consumer applications intended to entertain and inspire the public's confidence in American industry and scientific experts. Ultimately, the corporate sponsorship of the high school science extracurriculum at the World's Fair marked a turning point when the Progressive purposes of science education began to give way to ""manpower"" and ""professionalist"" ends that aligned with the nation's economic and military imperatives.

The framework is advanced as a means of addressing problems of practices faced by preservice teachers, creating coherence for the design of teacher education experiences, and serving as a tool for shaping a design-based research agenda. Findings of three research studies that examined preservice teachers' developing understandings and practices for teaching science as argument and the ways in which teacher education experiences mediated learning are synthesized. Across the studies, findings suggest that the framework serves as a powerful scaffold for preservice teachers' developing thinking and practice. More specifically, early attention to evidence and argument can leverage other important aspects of effective science teaching, such as attention to classroom discourse and the role of the teacher in monitoring and assessing children's thinking.

This literature, which is increasingly informing how and in which contexts professional developers design and implement programs, states that scientist's divergent research interests and knowledge about K-12 science teachers often limit their involvement in these programs. Conversely, concerns persist that there is very little empirical evidence to support these programmatic recommendations made by the science education literature. This embedded case study was bounded by the contextual similarities between seven professional development workshops with the goal of examining the relationship between scientist's views of teachers as professionals and the pedagogical orientations that the scientists used within these professional development contexts. Multiple methods were employed including systematic classroom observation by nine trained observers, as well as analysis of course materials, interviews, and questionnaires. Altogether, the teacher comments and observation data paint a picture of howthe instructors implemented specific pedagogical orientations.

These challenges include (1) engaging in science, (2) organizing instruction, and (3) understanding students. The science teacher educators use a dialogic third space to help the preservice teachers reconsider and develop deeper understandings of these problems of practice. In this introduction, we point out some of the common themes that tie these articles together, including (a) a focus on problems of practice in elementary science teaching, (b) a focus on dialogue with preservice teachers about these problems of practice, (c) a commitment to developing tools and approaches that support principled reasoning about these problems of practice, and (d) a commitment to shared goals and methods for research on elementary science teacher education.

From cultural-historical and sociocultural perspectives, this assumption is problematic because scientific practices are collective human activities and are therefore neither identical with students' experiences nor with the accounts of these experiences that students make available to researchers. ""Students' images of science"" are therefore translated from (rather than directly correspond to) scientific practices. Drawing on data collected during and after preuniversity biology students' internships in a scientific laboratory, we exemplify the role of these translations in the production of ""students' images of science."" A coarse-grained analysis based on existing research showed our data to be comparable with earlier studies on ""students' images of science."" A fine-grained analysis shows how ""students' images of science"" were coproduced along a trajectory of translations that was determined by the use of particular actions and tools, and a particular division of labor in scientific practice.

The first design cycle introduced preservice teachers to modeling and simulation software tools in an effort to advance their understanding of science and technology; the second used an instructional framework embodying modeling-centered inquiry to advance their views of effective science teaching and their lesson-planning practices; the third engaged preservice teachers in analyzing and modifying curriculum materials using reform-based criteria to foster effective curriculum materials use.

To that end, we examined a total of 43 trade books, 24 life science and 19 physical science, 7182 clauses in all, for the presence of explanation. We found significantly higher percentages (32.87) of explanatory clauses in physical science trade books than in life science (23.34) trade books.

It is argued that we need to look at ""real-time"" science to see how subtle interactions affect minority graduate students. These interactions reveal how identity is established through the positioning inside or outside of the laboratory culture. Three themes were explored regarding the tensions of identity formation in the context of race and science education: (1) the issue of isolation, marginalization, and invisibility; (2) being valued through recognition of one's contributions to the community of scientists; and (3) reading race as an additional burden for minority students.

First, we compare the use of ordered multiple-choice (OMC) and open-ended (OE) items for assessing students relative to the learning progression. OMC items appear to provide more precise diagnoses of students' learning progression levels and to be more valid, eliciting students' conceptions more similarly to cognitive interviews. Second, we explore evidence bearing on two challenges concerning reliability and validity of level diagnoses: the consistency with which students respond to items set in different contexts and the ways in which students interpret and use language in responding to items. As predicted, students do not respond consistently to similar problems set in different contexts. Although the language used in OMC items generally seems to reflect student thinking, misinterpretation of the language in items may lead to inaccurate diagnoses for a subset of students. Both issues are less problematic for classroom applications than for use of learning progressions in large-scale testing. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Alonzo, A.C.; Department of Teaching and Learning, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242-1529, United States; email: alicia-alonzo@uiowa.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

The investigation revealed a number of serious problems with the way nature of science is portrayed in the textbooks. Science was generally portrayed as collection of facts, not as a dynamic process of generating and testing alternative explanations about nature. The authors of the textbooks often appeared not to understand the processes well enough to explain them to students and therefore presented various misleading and inadequate descriptions regarding scientific enterprise, similar to those revealed by research on science teachers' and students' understandings of science. Furthermore, some important aspects of science were found to be neglected by textbooks.

First, do groups craft better arguments than individuals? Second, to what degree do individuals adopt and internalize the arguments crafted by their group? Third, do individuals who work in groups learn more from their experiences than individuals who work on their own? To examine these questions, 168 high school chemistry students were randomly assigned, using a matched pair design to collaborative or individual argumentation conditions. Students in both treatment conditions first completed a task that required them to produce an argument articulating and justifying an explanation for a discrepant event. The students then completed mastery and transfer problems on their own. The results of this study indicate that (a) groups of students did not produce better arguments than students who worked alone, (b) a substantial proportion of the students adopted at least some elements of their group's argument, and (c) students from the collaborative condition demonstrated superior performance on the mastery and transfer problems. These observations indicate that collaboration was beneficial for individual learning but not for initial performance on the task.

We conclude that, even among apparently highly collegial student groups, deemed by their teacher to be effective learning groups, and constituted in ways consistent with the literature on effective collaborative group work, there existed metasocial metacognitive factors that influenced and shaped cognition in ways counterproductive to the effective learning of science. This study reveals the existence of metacognitive knowledge and processes, common among students and related to their views of what is appropriate thinking and behavior within small groups, which inform collective and individual task actions. We contend that students are highly aware of their social status within groups and of their individual group's social conditions and that this awareness affects cognition and behavior. Moreover, they monitor these conditions and employ strategies that simultaneously service both the task and social relationships and their learning processes to varying extents depending on individual and group factors. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Anderson, D.; Department of Curriculum and Pedagogy, The University of British Columbia, 2125 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada; email: david.anderson@ubc.ca",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

We examine how the Exploratorium employed institutional resources that were available in its environment to develop a new type of organization: an interactive science center.

To appropriately frame the unique epistemology of technology in education, we propose a cognitive framework developed to understand the use and development of tools in human activity, namely, Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT). Drawing on a case study of technology that is not rooted in a (Eurocentric) scientific tradition, the SXOLE(Reef Net) fishing technology of the WSÁNEĆ (Saanich) people, we show how technology can be understood as inherent to human praxis, which presupposes a dialectically related and unique epistemology that is incommensurable and irreducible to a scientific worldview.

Paulo Freire developed a well-known approach to adult literacy based on his humanistic ideas through the dialogical process. From Freirean educational principles, the idea unfolds that a Freirean humanistic science education perspective is a political commitment to sociopolitical action, considering conditions of oppression in society. Although some humanistic science education approaches to school science have incorporated a sociopolitical perspective, it is showed that not all of them necessarily focus on the political purpose of transforming oppressive conditions in society as stressed by Paulo Freire. From this Freirean humanistic perspective, an approach to science education is then highlighted, which implies the introduction of socially relevant themes and socioscientific issues, the establishment of a dialogical process in classroom, and the development of sociopolitical action. Hence, a Freirean perspective of science education is presented as a radical view of scientific literacy.

All the problems dealt with the same scientific content. The recordings were analyzed to identify similarities and differences in the ways the problems were solved and to see which steps in the solution of the problems posed the greatest cognitive difficulty for each participant. Results indicate that (a) the process of making the constraining assumptions needed to convert the real-world problem into a well-defined one was the most difficult step for all, and (b) only the participants who had prior experience making constraining assumptions were able to make the needed assumptions and solve the real-world problem. These findings suggest a need to support physics students develop this important skill. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Fortus, D.; Department of Science Teaching, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel; email: david.fortus@weizmann.ac.il",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Driver, P. Newton, & J. Osborne, 2000). In this paper, we identify three goals of engaging in these related scientific practices: (1) sensemaking, (2) articulating, and (3) persuading. We propose using these goals to understand student engagement with these practices, and to design instructional interventions to support students. Thus, we use this framework as a lens to investigate the question: What successes and challenges do students face as they engage in the scientific practices of explanation and argumentation? We study this in the context of a curriculum that provides students and teachers with an instructional framework for constructing and defending scientific explanations. Through this analysis, we find that students consistently use evidence to make sense of phenomenon and articulate those understandings but they do not consistently attend to the third goal of persuading others of their understandings. Examining the third goal more closely reveals that persuading others of an understanding requires social interactions that are often inhibited by traditional classroom interactions. Thus, we conclude by proposing design strategies for addressing the social challenges inherent in the related scientific practices of explanation and argumentation. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Berland, L.

After we introduced a label to help visitors explore the insulating properties of clothing, we found a dramatic shift in the kinds of activities and participation structures of visitors. Not only were visitors, as expected, discussing why clothing was warm, but they were doing so in a fashion more consistent with formal education than the typically more collaborative conversations seen in informal learning environments.

Most studies treat scaffolding as a one-way process, where the expert supports the development of the novice. However, if social processes generally and conversations specifically are dialogical in nature then we would expect to observe two-way processes. The purpose of this paper is to report the results of an ethnographic study of high school students' internships in a scientific laboratory. Data were collected through observation, fieldnotes, and videotaping. Drawing on discursive psychology and conversation analysis, we find that laboratory technicians and students draw on different forms of discursive strategies to articulate knowledgeability while transacting with each other. We put forth the notion of emergent expertise to describe new forms of expertise that are not a property of individuals but rather the product of collective transactions. Our study illustrates the importance of opportunities generated in the internship for both old-timers and newcomers to bring about knowledgeability. This study implies a rethinking of the role of the expert and the notion of scaffolding, which puts more emphasis on the transactional process rather than on learners as recipients. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Hsu, P.-L.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Faculty of Education, University of Victoria, Victoria, V8W 3N4, BC, Canada; email: phsu@uvic.ca",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Scientific understanding is but one of the many types of meanings that can accrue to a given place. People develop emotional attachments to meaningful places. The sense of place, encompassing the meanings and attachments that places hold for people, has been well characterized in environmental psychology. Its components, place attachment and place meaning, can be measured psychometrically. Place-based science teaching focuses on local and regional environments and synthesizes different ways of knowing them, leveraging the senses of place of students and teachers. Place-based teaching has been advocated for its relevance and potential to attract underrepresented groups to science. We posit that sense of place is a measurable learning outcome of place-based science teaching. We developed an Arizona-based, culturally inclusive, meaning-rich introductory geology course, and used published surveys to assess place attachment and meaning in students who took the course. We observed significant gains in student place attachment and place meaning, indicating that these instruments are generalizable and sensitive enough for use in this context.

Furthermore, little is known about how scientists' views of science education may differ from those held by science teachers. Through the use of semistructured interviews, the perceptions of 37 scientists from diverse science domains and 21 middle and high school science teachers were explored. Participating scientists expressed concerns about the variability in quality of teaching, programs, and resources available for science instruction. Scientists expressed a desire for teachers to have more experience conducting science research and developing their own critical thinking skills. When asked what goals are most important for science education, 40% of the scientists emphasized that teachers should make science fun and exciting for their students. Science teachers' perceptions of science education were compared with the scientists' perceptions. Thirty percent of the teachers agreed with the scientists that too much variability in program or instructional quality exists in science education. Seventy-six percent of the science teachers also thought there is a need to teach critical thinking skills, but more importantly there is a need to inspire creativity and a desire to learn science in students. Both teachers and scientists expressed concerns about how high-stakes accountability inhibits efforts to improve science education. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Taylor, A.

This is particularly true vis-à-vis science education. While classrooms have diversified, science instruction has not necessarily followed suit. Two theories, constructivism and culturally relevant pedagogy, have been identified as mechanisms to diminish the disparities in science education. Yet culturally relevant pedagogy has not had the same impact as constructivism, even though it has been posited as a crucial means to better assure ethnic minority access to education. A case study of two classroom teachers investigates whether and how constructivism can be leveraged to develop culturally relevant pedagogy in science instruction.

Using eye-tracking technology and sequential analysis, this study investigated how high school students (n = 54) with different levels of prior knowledge transitioned among the macroscopic and molecular representations of the selected cell transport graphics. The results indicated that high prior knowledge students transitioned more frequently between the molecular representations, whereas low prior knowledge students transitioned more frequently between the macroscopic representations. These findings suggest that students with high prior knowledge distributed their visual attention on conceptually relevant features, whereas low prior knowledge students focused on surface features. In addition, low prior knowledge students transitioned more frequently between macroscopic and molecular representations, suggesting that these students were experiencing more difficulty as they were coordinating the representations. Because these students were using surface features to create linkages between the representations, they were unable to understand the underlying themes. More research on the differences in the distribution of visual attention among learners can provide further insight as to the difficulties low prior knowledge students face when interpreting multiple representations. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Cook, M.; Eugene T.

Students' written responses and statements in classroom discussions around each of the prompts are compared. Results indicate that the relative success of the prompts in eliciting a range of conceptions may depend on the openness and familiarity of the prompts. Prompts with fewer constraints and unfamiliar settings elicited a range of student conceptions in writing; however, discussions surrounding the prompts were more likely to elicit ideas at the expected level, or no student ideas at all. A comparison of the prompts revealed that the diversity of students' responses in writing was not reflected in classroom discussions. The study suggests that open-format formative assessment prompts may function better when used as a basis for teachers to elicit a range of student ideas in writing, whereas constrained-outcome space prompts may be more appropriate for whole-class conversations that focus students upon scientifically appropriate responses. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Furtak, E.M.; School of Education, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309, United States; email: erin.furtak@colorado.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Data from interviews, participant observation, and artifacts offer a narrative of how she became aware of the ""game rules"" of scientific discourse. The findings are expressed in terms of a cartographic metaphor where the student's world became less of a list of categories and more of a map outlining where she ventured and the ways in which she oriented herself to scientific language. To facilitate the border crossing and reduce the obstacles that some students experience in crossing between worldviews, educators can look at cross-cultural perspectives and explore with students how language fosters or hinders their progress. This research suggests that we allow room in our pedagogy for students to learn the rules of using scientific language, make explicit the cultural norms associated with this practice, thereby promoting a ""metaknowledge"" of how scientific discourse functions in the academy. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Brandt, C.B.; Department of Teaching and Learning, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061, United States; email: cbbrandt@vt.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

For preservice teachers to learn to use science curriculum materials in productive ways, they must develop a conception of themselves as elementary teachers in which the use of science curriculum materials is a valued dimension of science-teaching practice. We define those dimensions of teachers' professional role identities concerned with the use of curriculum materials as curricular role identity. This mixed-methods study examines preservice elementary teachers' development of curricular role identity for science teaching through their use of science curriculum materials. Forty-seven preservice elementary teachers in two sections of an elementary science methods course were studied over the course of one semester. Data sources include survey results from preservice teachers in both course sections as well as interviews, observations, and course artifacts from preservice teachers studied in-depth. Results suggest preservice teachers articulate important differences between their own and more experienced elementary teachers' curricular role identity for science teaching and make progress toward appropriating the latter. Supporting them to do so requires emphasizing interactions with science curriculum materials as part of teacher education and providing classroom-based experiences through which they can put their developing curricular role identities into action. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Forbes, C.T.; Department of Educational Studies, School of Education, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1259, United States; email: ctforbes@umich.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

The findings show that commercial reading programs have changed substantially from the days when they were dominated by literary texts and contained hardly any science. Now, there is a variety of genres and scientific content in about one fifth of the selections. The content is also generally accurate. So, there is considerable potential offered by these programs for teaching children to read science. Unfortunately, the findings also show that the recommended instructional strategies and assessment techniques do little to capitalize upon this potential. In particular, the findings demonstrate that, although most of the science is cast in the expository genre, most of the recommended instruction and assessment is more appropriate to the literary genres. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Norris, S.P.; Centre for Research in Youth, Science Teaching and Learning, Canadian Centre for Research on Literacy, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alta.

As commonly implemented in venues ranging from middle school classrooms to undergraduate laboratories, it emphasizes the testing of predictions rather than ideas, focuses learners on material activity at the expense of deep subject matter understanding, and lacks epistemic framing relevant to the discipline. While critiques of the scientific method are not new, its cumulative effects on learners' conceptions of science have not been clearly articulated. We discuss these effects using findings from a series of five studies with degree-holding graduates of our educational system who were preparing to enter the teaching profession and apprentice their own young learners into unproblematic images of how science is done. We then offer an alternative vision for investigative science - model-based inquiry (MBI) - as a system of activity and discourse that engages learners more deeply with content and embodies five epistemic characteristics of scientific knowledge: that ideas represented in the form of models are testable, revisable, explanatory, conjectural, and generative.

This nature is determined by the interplay of the notions of classification (content specialization) and formality (code specialization) modulated by both the linguistic and the visual expressive modes. The results of the relevant analysis showed that the textual materials employed in PISA and in school textbooks are oppositional in nature. Specifically, while the linguistic mode of the PISA items tends to resemble texts falling within the public domain (nonspecialized content and code), the corresponding visual mode tends to resemble texts of the esoteric domain (specialized content and code) thus familiarizing students with the specialized conventions and ways of representing entities falling within the realm of technoscientific knowledge. On the other hand, school science textbooks tend to employ the linguistic and the visual mode in exactly the opposite way. These differences between PISA science items and school science textbooks could contribute to a disorientation of the students in relation to what is expected in each specific context. This disparity could potentially be one of the factors explaining the low level of Greek students' attainment in PISA. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Hatzinikita, V.; Hellenic Open University, School of Humanities, Sahtouri 23, 26222 Patras, Greece",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Studies have shown that students are more likely to select careers when they can identify a role model in that career path. Further research has shown that the success of this strategy is enhanced by the use of gender-matched role models. While prior work provides insights into the value of using role models, it does not explain the cognitive process involved in girls identifying role models from nontraditional careers for women. This feminist study addresses this gap by examining the cognitive process eighth-grade girls use in identifying a person as a science role model and comparing it to the process used by women scientists seeking to serve as possible science role models. Data revealed that the girls' process in identifying a role model involved personal connections and their initial image of a scientist led them to believe they could not have such a connection with a scientist. The initial views expressed by the women suggested they felt pressure to portray ""perfect"" scientists in order to be a role model. A common understanding of a science role model was realized only after changes occurred in the girls' image of scientists and the scientists' image of a role model. The catalysts for these changes were the relationships that developed between girls and women scientists. ©2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Buck, G.A.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405-1006, United States; email: gabuck@indiana.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

The participants for this study included four faculty instructors and two purposively selected student groups, totaling eight students. We found the instructors' two course goals, (a) teaching students how scientists do science and (b) using an interdisciplinary approach to develop students' content knowledge of the big ideas in science, were consistent with our observations and the students' descriptions of their experience in the course. However, we observed, and the students also noted, an important feature of the course that the instructors did not describe as a course goal was its reliance on the social nature of learning.

The research explored the effect of explicit attention to epistemic practices in curriculum materials and the enactment of those materials. Epistemic practices include asking questions, collecting data, making descriptions of observations, finding patterns in the data, and developing scientific reasoning. Scaffolding considered the function, role, and purpose of epistemic practices in the community of science and the production of scientific knowledge. The designed curriculum was compared with an existing pedagogically similar curriculum to consider whether the scaffolding and explicitness affected enactment. Findings lead to the conclusion that enactment was impacted. Specifically, findings show that scaffolding in materials created more instances of students engaging in scientific reasoning. Similarly, the explicit description of epistemic practices supported the teacher in explicitly providing opportunities for children to learn about and use epistemic practices of science. Finally, when using the designed curriculum, teacher modifications during enactment showed to be more consistent with the intended instructional approach and also helpful for children in learning epistemic practices of science. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Enfield, M.; School of Education, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, United States; email: menfield@email.unc.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In addressing such an issue, we first propose an epistemological discussion based on the works of Cartwright (1983, 1999), Fleck (1935/1979), and Hacking (1983). This leads us to emphasize the transitions between the abstract and the concrete in the modeling process, by using the notions of nomogical machine (Cartwright, 1999), language game (Wittgenstein, 1953/1997), and thought style (Fleck, 1935/1979). Then, in the light of our epistemological approach, we study four cases coming from the implementations of research-based design activities (SESAMES, 2007). These four case studies illustrate how students are engaged in constructing relations between the abstract and the concrete through modeling activities, by elaborating at the same time specific language games and appropriate thought styles. Finally, we draw some implications for science teaching.

The theoretical framework developed by Callon, Lascoumes, and Barthe (2001) was drawn on to show how the group assigns roles relating to public representation and the production of legitimate knowledges; in particular, it assigns to scientists the role of conducting research; to government the roles of building citizens' awareness about the risks related to cellular telephone use, protecting users, and guiding the conduct of the cellular telephone industry; and to citizens the roles of becoming/staying informed and of making limited use of cellular telephones. The study reported here also illustrates that, in the process, the group airs their views concerning the terms best suited to defining the subject of the controversy, constituting research ""collectives,"" and disseminating knowledge.

A ""grasp"" of scientific practice as such is instrumental to learning because informational content of scientific knowledge lies not only on the level of facts, but also on the levels of methods and values, and coordinating information across these levels is crucial for understanding. In contrast to prevailing constructivist ideas that highlight student authority to construct knowledge as scientists do, this model emphasizes the importance of knowing how to hold claims accountable. Thus, the ideal vision of students making their own sense of content is superceded by a more defensible ideal vision of students learning how to make scientific sense of content. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Ford, M.; Department of Instruction and Learning, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, United States; email: mjford@pitt.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

We have adapted an account of mechanism from philosophy of science studies in professional science [Machamer, P., Darden, D., & Craver, C. F., (2000). Thinking about mechanisms. Philosophy of Science, 67, 1-25] to develop a framework for discourse analysis that aids in identifying and analyzing students' mechanistic reasoning.

Until recently, only a few quantitative studies have investigated the relationship between high school students' conceptions of learning science and the approaches they adopt to learning science. This study sought to address this gap in the literature by assessing these possible relationships empirically through the development of two questionnaires: The Conceptions of Learning Science (COLS) questionnaire and the Approaches to Learning Science (ALS) questionnaire. Four hundred and seventy-four Taiwanese high school students were administered the COLS questionnaire and the ALS questionnaire. Results were entered into a structural equation model to elicit structural relations between students' conceptions of and their approaches to learning science. Overall, findings revealed that students holding constructivist conceptions of learning science tended to employ deep approaches to learning science. Conceptions of learning science such as ""testing"" and ""calculate and practice"" were also found to have effects on the surface approaches to learning science; the conceptions of learning science as ""applying"" and ""understanding and seeing in a new way"" had noticeable effects on deep approaches to learning science. This study employed quantitative methods to confirm further the structural relations existing between conceptions of learning science and the motives and strategies employed in learning science.

Change was found to be multifaceted, with details of unused content fading from memory, alongside growth that results from improved understanding and reorganization of structure more than from accretion of new material. Across personal and professional life tracks that produce variation between individuals, development is facilitated by ""critical mass"" of teachers' knowledge and interest in their chosen disciplines of study and certification, whereas deficiencies tend to persist in the other subjects they are asked to teach. The required curriculum is the single most powerful determinant of teacher knowledge, serving as both its organizer and source.

The other, based on constructivism, has centered on interactive multimedia, allowing students to build their own knowledge. Attempting to build on both bodies of literature, in this study, we investigated techniques that can raise the useful cognitive load engendered with linear multimedia. Participating online from home, students were pre- and posttested around a short multimedia intervention that explained Newton's first and second laws. In Experiment 1, students who watched a video dialogue involving alternative conceptions reported investing greater mental effort and achieved higher posttest scores than students who received a standard lecture-style presentation. In Experiment 2, two additional multimedia treatments were evaluated to assess the role of instructional time and the method of addressing alternative conceptions. In all, 272 students participated in the experiments. Interviews suggest that students adopted a more active approach to understanding the material if alternative conceptions were raised.

Beginning teachers rely heavily on curriculum materials that are often of poor quality to guide their practice. As a result, we argue that preservice teachers need to learn how to use curriculum materials for effective teaching. To address this concern, the authors conducted a study in which three teacher educators taught elementary science methods courses incorporating a major focus on curriculum analysis and modification based on Project 2061 Instructional Analysis Criteria. Analysis of pre-post assessments, classroom artifacts, classroom dialogue, and postcourse interviews indicated that preservice teachers accurately applied and appropriated a modest set of criteria whose intended meanings most closely matched their own understandings, were most closely aligned with their own goals and criteria, or were made accessible through systematic use and attention within the methods sections. However, many did not find the materials analysis criteria useful or comprehensible and based their curricular decisions on their own criteria. Furthermore, some preservice teachers resisted engaging in these practices that may have seemed too analytical, inauthentic, and destabilizing. These findings pointed us toward a revised theoretical framework and new approaches to better support preservice teachers' effective participation with curriculum materials. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Schwarz, C.

The participants were two classes of second-year senior high school students in Taiwan. Overall, the results showed that most students developed a deep and accessible understanding of the reasons for the seasons after undergoing experiences provided by the TEL course. More importantly, it was found that, in this technologically enhanced environment, the student-centered approach was more effective than the teacher-guided approach in altering students' alternative conceptions of seasonal change (F = 28.05, p ≤ 0.001). The conceptual evolution of students in the two groups was plotted and compared. These plots indicated that, first of all, the cognitive processes of contextualization and sense making helped students re-examine their old ideas about the phenomena, leading them to generate alternative conceptions and undergo both positive and negative conceptual change.

Misconceptions did not constrain the development of students' reasoning. Rather, their reasoning developed in response to the contingencies of the specific situation. When misconceptions were encountered, they appeared as alternatives and questions not actively defended. Sometimes, encounters with these misconceptions were generative of the students' reasoning.

""Ambiguous"" objects, such as a baggie with air, shaving cream, a baggie of salt that children were asked to sort, encouraged them to debate ideas about states of matter. Children used four ways of reasoning about states of matter: macroscopic properties, prototypes, everyday functions, and process of elimination. Furthermore, children's meaning making was intertwined with various socio-organizational aspects of inquiry-the ways in which children negotiated their roles within their group and in wholeclass sessions, how they worked with each other, how their ideas were heard by others.

In particular, we analyzed college chemistry students' predictions about the color, smell, and taste of the products of chemical reactions represented at the molecular level. The study was designed to explore the extent to which novice learners intuitively use an additive framework to predict the properties of the product, rather than an approach that recognizes the emergent nature of the properties of chemical compounds. To this end, we used a mixed-methods research approach based on answers to multiple-choice questions and individual interviews with students enrolled in the first year of an introductory general chemistry course for science and engineering majors. Our results indicate that most students at this level rely on an additive heuristic to predict the properties of chemical compounds, overlooking the possibility of emergent properties resulting from the interaction of the atoms that compose the system. Chemistry instructors and chemical educators thus need to intentionally design learning opportunities for students to recognize and differentiate additive and emergent properties in a variety of contexts. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Talanquer, V.; Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, United States; email: vicente@u.arizona.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

From using this model in the development and enactment of the curriculum, we identified three important characteristics: unpacking national science standards, developing a learning performances approach to specifying learning goals, and aligning learning goals, instructional activities, and assessments. Using a case study of an IQWST unit from initial development through two cycles of enactment, we describe how these three characteristics help guide curriculum design, identify design issues in curriculum enactments, and guide the development of design solutions.

For the case study aspect, we focused on the cases of three women participating in the support program via participant observations and in-depth interviews. For a more general description, we developed a questionnaire and augmented this with interviews with a broad spectrum of students. Our findings illustrated that the program demonstrated a great potential to aid the traditionally marginalized to move from marginality to legitimate participation in the communities of science. The program functioned successfully in four ways, each interwoven with the others.

Most undergraduate science programs require introductory physics coursework. Thus, success in introductory physics is usually necessary for students to progress to higher levels of science study. Success also influences attitudes; if females are well prepared, feel confident, and do well in introductory physics, they may be inclined to study physics further. This quantitative study using a hierarchical linear model focused on determining factors from high school physics preparation (content, pedagogy, and assessment) and the affective domain that predicted female and male performance in introductory university physics. The data analyzed came from 1973 introductory university physics surveys that included variables used as controls for student demographic and academic background characteristics. The results highlight high school physics and affective experiences that differentially predicted female and male performance. These experiences include learning requirements, long-written problems, cumulative tests/quizzes, father's encouragement, and family's belief that science leads to a better career. There were also factors that had a similar effect on female and male performance among which mathematics preparation was the overall strongest predictor of university physics performance. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Hazari, Z.; Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA 02138, United States; email: zhazari@cfa.harvard.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Findings suggest that the type of exhibit constrains the nature of the understanding achieved. The use of analogical reasoning may lead to an intended causal explanation of an exhibit that is an exemplar of a phenomenon, but visitors often express misconceptions as a consequence of using this type of exhibit. Analogy-based exhibits are often not used as intended by the designer. This may be because visitors do not access the source domain intended; are unaware of the use of analogy per se (in particular, when the exhibit is of the subtype only showing similarities between relationships""); only acquire fragmentary knowledge about the target; or fail to use analogical reasoning of which they were capable.

The aim of this paper is to establish a framework that overcomes this opposition between multiculturalism and universalism in science education, so that they become but one-sided expressions of an integrated unit. To be able to do so, we abandon the concept of ""truth."" Instead, we adopt a contemporary epistemology that (a) entails both the cultural and material aspects of human, intersubjective reality; (b) concerns the usefulness of knowledge; and (c) highlights the dynamic, heterogeneous, and plural nature of products of human being and understanding. Drawing on narratives of scientists and aboriginal people explaining a comparable natural phenomenon (a salmon run), we show that both TEK and scientific knowledge, though simultaneously available, are incommensurable and irreducible to each other, as are the different processes of knowledge construction/evolution inherent to the constituting artifacts. Drawing on social studies of science, we point out that the transcendent nature of scientific knowledge implies absence of local heterogeneity, dynamic, and plurality making it useless in local contexts other than itself.

Learners from non-African schools performed significantly better than learners from African schools. Three readability factors (sentence complexity, unfamiliar words, and long words) were analyzed. High sentence complexity resulted in random guessing in non-African schools, and favoring an incorrect answer in African schools. Some TIMSS items have complex wording, with numerous prepositional phrases and clauses, and unclear questions. Recommendations for maximum readability and comprehensibility were not met, and these items are therefore invalid for learners with limited English-language proficiency.

This article attempts to address this gap in the research literature, delving into the unique challenges and instructional responses to teaching detracked science. The authors report on a case study of two chemistry teachers' heterogeneous classrooms at a racially diverse, public high school in California, where all students have been required to take chemistry since the school's founding in 1994. The authors highlight the following four beliefs and instructional practices that were instrumental in teachers' successful efforts to teach detracked chemistry classes: (1) teachers' true belief in a developmental conception ofability and intelligence; (2) a focus on an inquiry-based pedagogical approach to chemistry foregrounding real-world contexts; (3) a focus on teaching students study skills; and (4) a strong sense of community in the classroom, where students are held responsible for their own and each other's learning. To illustrate each of these findings, the authors select vivid examples from fieldnotes of classroom observations as well as interviews of teachers and students that make clear how teachers enacted and students experienced these elements in chemistry classrooms. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Watanabe, M.; Department of Secondary Education, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA 94132, United States; email: watanabe@sfsu.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Taking an interactive perspective, the study investigates ninth graders' cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement in teacher-centered (TC) and student-centered (SC) technology-enhanced classrooms. 54 students from two science classes in Taiwan participated in this study. Multiple sources of data were collected during a 3-week instructional unit. The statistical results showed that although students in the SC class reported having significantly higher emotional engagement, the emotional engagement level had no impact on students' learning achievement. Analyses of qualitative data showed that students in both classes spent a majority of class time on cognitive involvement in learning activities, but there were qualitative differences in cognitive and behavioral engagement between the two classes. One type of activities that did not occur in the TC class was making reflections in which students in the SC class self-assessed what they did. In addition, the SC class usually interacted through group discussions provoked by the simulations, whereas the TC class frequently interacted through initiation-response-evaluation sequences and engaged in student-initiated discussions. The findings suggest that both instructional approaches promoted students' conceptual understanding and provided students with different opportunities to engage in science learning. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Wu, H.-K.; Graduate Institute of Science Education, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, 116, Taiwan; email: hkwu@ntnu.edu.tw",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Identity theory is used as a theoretical lens to make sense of and better address some of the unique challenges of becoming a reform-minded science teacher, a professional identity that does not reflect the common norm in the profession; these challenges include the emotional risk and possible need for ""repair work,"" lack of familiarity with and buy-in into complex practices of inquiry, and the need for opportunities to participate in competent practice and have this participation acknowledged. Two basic design principles for science teacher preparation are identified as a result of this analysis: (a) the need to create safe places and scaffolded ways for beginning science teachers to try on and develop their identities as reform-minded science teachers, which may include capitalizing on the unique opportunities of practice teaching in out-of-school contexts; and (b) the need to offer opportunities to be recognized, by self and others, as reform-minded teachers through ongoing, structured, and supported reflection. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Luehmann, A.L.; Warner Graduate School of Education and Human Development, University of Rochester, Dewey Hall 1-160L, Rochester, NY 14627, United States; email: april.luehmann@rochester.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

The intervention was similarly successful for a majority of students in the present study, enabling them to isolate the three causal and two noncausal variables operating in a multivariable system. However, when asked to predict outcomes of various constellations of variable levels, they tended not to take into account the effects of all of the causal variables they had identified. Moreover, they did not adhere to a consistency principle, i.e., that a factor that produces an effect can be expected to produce the same effect in the future, given similar conditions. These findings suggest that COV is not the only challenge students experience in reasoning about multiple variables. Elementary-school students' mental models of multivariable causality appear to deviate from a normative, scientific model, even after they have mastered that aspect of scientific method having to do with the design of controlled experiments to isolate effects of individual variables. The challenges, beyond COV, that appear to be involved in making prediction judgments involving multiple variables warrant attention in the design of curricula to foster development of scientific thinking skills. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Kuhn, D.; Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, United States; email: dkl00@columbia.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This dichotomy between ISI and IHE was persistent across thematic categories: (1) language use and meaning, (2) teacher outcomes as a result of PD, (3) resource strengths for teaching and learning, and (4) determination of content and course offerings. The significance of this research is threefold. First, the identification and characterization of important features of teacher PD in ISI is an important contribution to the PD literature, since most previous studies focus on IHE.

The hierarchical constructs used to describe reflection, however, are often interpreted in ways that promote reflection as a tool teachers use to elevate their views and practices toward ideal ""end goals"" rather than as a more complex intellectual act that could help them learn how to shape their own goals. This research explores how four early career science teachers learned to negotiate the conflicts between their own goals and actual practices by situating their reflections in multiple contexts. They were invited to become aware of those conflicts through interviews and discussions of classroom observations and then to address them by actually teaching toward their own unrealized goals. The data generated from these activities were described with a rubric based on M. van Manen's reflection construct (1977) but were framed with certain perceptions each teacher had about her or his own science teaching. Several patterns emerged across the four teachers' cases that challenge the use of reflection as a tool and suggest how science teachers can reflect as a way to take greater ownership over and responsibility for their own lifelong learning. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Danielowich, R.; Department of Teacher Education, College of Education, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, IL 60625, United States; email: danielowich@hotmail.com",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

As a result, high-school students around the world lack fundamental understanding of chemical bonding. In order to improve students' understanding of this concept, it was essential to propose a systemic treatment, namely, revising the scientific content, the pedagogical approach, and the assessment methods regarding this concept. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to build a conceptual framework that provides an advanced scientific and pedagogical foundation regarding the chemical bonding concept - one that will guide chemistry curriculum developers as well. A conceptual framework for a new teaching approach was constructed with lead-chemistry teachers, science (chemistry) educators, and research chemists. We suggest that chemical bonding should be taught based on elemental principles and by using the idea of a continuum of bond strengths. Our process includes the formulation of learning goals aligned with current scientific knowledge. Moreover, we suggest that constructing assessment tasks on carefully specified learning goals, which are described in terms of learning performances, may enable educators to foster and examine much deeper levels of students' understanding. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Nahum, T.L.; Department of Science Teaching, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel; email: ntami@weizmann.ac.il",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This study was descriptive in nature and reflected a cross-age design involving the collection of qualitative data from 915 students from the Midwest, United States. These qualitative data were analyzed for their content in an inductive manner, identifying student's conceptions. This content analysis was followed with a statistical analysis to determine the significance in the frequency of the identified student conceptions. Four categories emerged that reflected these students' conceptions.

In the present work, we examine acquisition of this strategy among students of the same age as those studied by Klahr and Nigam, as well as follow central features of their design in directly comparing the two methods. In contrast to their design, however, we follow progress over an extended time period and a range of equivalent tasks. Three groups of 15 fourth-grade students, of diverse socioeconomic background, were compared. One group engaged in 12 sessions over 10 weeks working on problems that required the control-of-variables strategy for effective solution. Another group engaged in the same activity, preceded by a session involving direct instruction on the control-of-variables strategy. A third group received only the initial direct instruction, without subsequent engagement and practice. In this longer term framework, direct instruction appears to be neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for robust acquisition or for maintenance over time. The patterns of attainment observed here point instead to a gradual and extended process of acquisition and consolidation. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Kuhn, D.; Center for AIDS and STD, School of Social Work, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98104, United States; email: dk100@columbia.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Porlán, A. Rivero, and R. Martín del Pozo (1997), and a semistructured interview. The results showed the process of change in conceptions to be complex and gradual, with different conceptions being out of phase with each other. During her first 4 years of teaching, until 1993, her conceptions of science teaching and learning began to evolve from a teacher and content-centered model to one that was more student centered. The catalyst of the change in her initial conceptions of teaching and learning was her becoming aware of the students' alternative ideas. Her empiricist conception of the nature of science, however, remained practically unaltered during these first 4 years. This conception began to shift slowly toward less dogmatic and more up-to-date positions as a consequence of her changing view of teaching-learning, and by 2002, there was again coherence between her scientific thinking and her ideas on science teaching and learning. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Mellado, V.; Department of Science and Mathematics Education, Faculty of Education, University of Extremadura, 06071 Badajoz, Spain; email: vmellado@unex.es",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This paper reviews the detailed research evidence from 17 experimental studies undertaken in eight different countries on the effects of context-based and STS approaches, drawing on the findings of two systematic reviews of the research literature. The review findings indicate that context-based/STS approaches result in improvement in attitudes to science and that the understanding of scientific ideas developed is comparable to that of conventional approaches. The approaches also result in more positive attitudes to science in both girls and boys and reduce the gender differences in attitudes. The paper also considers issues emerging from work in the area in relation to study design and the constraints which may militate against the use of experimental research designs when gathering evidence of impact of interventions. A fundamental constraint is the extent to which it is possible to make comparisons between existing methods and interventions when the aims are overlapping but also differ in significant ways. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Bennett, J.; Department of Educational Studies, University of York, York, YO10 5DD, United Kingdom; email: jmb20@york.ac.uk",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

In this study, we identified such nonscientific presuppositions among 17- to 18-year-old secondary school students from the Igbo community of Southeastern Nigeria. We designed a research-based instructional model to address these presuppositions. The relationship between the levels of nonscientific presuppositions held by students and their achievement in genetics was assessed. Finally, the effect of the instructional model on students' relinquishing these non-scientific presuppositions and on their achievement was determined relative to a comparison group. It was found that this group of students had nonscientific presuppositions that they used in explaining genetic phenomena, and that the present instructional model aided the students in relinquishing these nonscientific presuppositions to a great extent.

Observations (n = 700) conducted at seven sites within the caverns documented sign reading, time spent listening to the audio, within group conversation, and other social behaviors for a different sample of visitors. Pretested tour users and nonusers did not differ in visitor characteristics, knowledge, or attitude variables, suggesting the two populations were similar. On a 12-item knowledge quiz, tour users' scores increased from 5.7 to 10.3, and nonusers' scores increased from 6.2 to 8.4. Most visitors were able to identify some of the park's major messages when presented with a multiple-choice question, but more audio users than nonusers identified resource preservation as a primary message in an open-ended question. Based on observations, audio tour users and nonusers did not differ substantially in their interactions with other members of their group or in their reading of interpretive signs in the cave. Audio tour users had positive reactions to the tour, and these reactions, coupled with the positive learning outcomes and negligible effects on social interaction, suggest that audio tours can be an effective communication medium in informal educational settings. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Novey, L.T.115 S.

Findings showed the ways in which educators adapted their preplanned lessons to the students' interests, needs, and understanding by manipulating the sequence and timing. The data revealed that, contrary to depictions in the research literature of teaching in museums as didactic and lecture oriented, there was creativity, complexity, and skills involved in teaching science in museums. Finally, the educators' teaching actions were predominantly influenced by their affective goals to nurture interests in science and learning. Although their lessons were ephemeral experiences, these educators operated from a perspective, which regarded a school field trip to the science museum, not as a one-time event, but as part of a continuum of visiting such institutions well beyond school and childhood. These findings have implications for the pedagogical practices employed by museum educators, and the relationship between teachers and educators during school field trips, which are discussed. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Tran, L.U.; Center for Informal Learning and Schools, King's College London, London SE1 9NH, United Kingdom; email: lynn.tran@kcl.ac.uk",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Data come from ethnographic research conducted in a diverse eighth-grade urban magnet school classroom in which the teacher taught out of field for part of the year. Contrary to expectations, more students participated and reported enjoying science when the teacher was out of field. Analysis of classroom interactions indicated that while in field, the teacher primarily engaged in ""front stage"" performances that hid her struggles with the material and accentuated students' views of science as an elite status group. The types of solidarity that developed among students often did not involve science language and sometimes involved students rejecting peers' claims to membership. However, when out of field, the teacher allowed students into her ""backstage,"" where her struggles and learning processes were more explicit. These practices lessened the social distance between teacher and students, and reduced the risks of using science language, thereby encouraging solidarity and group membership. This study provides insights into some of the ways that teachers, particularly those in urban settings characterized by diversity, might be more successful at facilitating identity formation and learning in science. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Olitsky, S.; Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania, 3700 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States; email: solitsky@dolphin.upenn.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

This study, by collecting research data from four Taiwanese science teachers, their students, and classroom observations, was carried out to examine the coherences between teachers' SEVs and their (1) teaching beliefs, (2) instructional practices, (3) students' SEVs, and (4) students' perceptions toward actual science learning environments. The findings suggested adequate coherences between teachers' SEVs and their teaching beliefs as well as instructional practices. The teachers with relatively positivist-aligned SEVs tended to draw attention to students' science scores in tests and allocate more instructional time on teacher-directed lectures, tutorial problem practices, or in-class examinations, implying a more passive or rote perspective about learning science. In contrast, teachers with constructivist-oriented SEVs tended to focus on student understanding and application of scientific concepts and they adopted more time on student inquiry activities or interactive discussion. These findings are quite consistent with the results about the coherence between teachers' SEVs and students' perceptions toward science learning environments, suggesting that the constructivist- oriented SEVs appeared to foster the creation of more constructivist-oriented science learning environments. Finally, although this study provided some evidence that teachers' SEVs were likely related to their students' SEVs, the teachers' SEVs and those of their students were not obviously coherent. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Tsai, C.-C.; Graduate School of Technological and Vocational Education, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei 106, Taiwan; email: cctsai@mail.nctu.edu.tw",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Here we renew a discussion of a 300-year pursuit in the United States toward educational landscapes that contribute to students' lives.

Specifically, the authors studied the effect of using a guided inquiry and modeling instructional framework (EIMA) and accompanying science methods instruction on preservice elementary teachers' science lesson design skills, scientific model use, and teaching orientations. Analysis of preservice teachers' pre-posttests, classroom artifacts, peer interviews, and lesson plans throughout the semester indicates that the framework successfully built on preservice teachers' prior instructional ideas, and that the majority of preservice teachers learned and used the framework in their lesson plans and teaching. Additionally, analysis of pre-posttest differences indicates an increase in posttest lesson plans that focused on engaging students in scientific inquiry using several kinds of models. Most importantly, the framework and accompanying instruction enabled two thirds of the class to move their teaching orientations away from discovery or didactic approaches toward reform-based approaches such as conceptual change, inquiry, and guided inquiry. Results from this study show that using instructional frameworks such as EIMA can enable preservice teachers to socially construct, synthesize, and apply their knowledge for enacting reform-oriented science teaching approaches such as model-centered scientific inquiry. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Schwarz, C.V.; Teacher Education, Michigan State University, 332 Erickson Hall, East Lansing, MI 48824, United States; email: cschwarz@msu.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Barriers to connecting school knowledge and workplace knowledge include the nature of science (its purpose, accountability, and substance), the structure of knowledge in each setting, the form content knowledge takes, the sequence that the curriculum is presented in, and the gatekeeping that occurs when knowledge is accessed.

Based on previous studies, we assumed that ""outdoor"" learning is different from classroom-based learning, and free choice learning in the museums enhances the expression of learning in personal context. We studied about 750 students participating in class visits at four museums, focusing on the levels of choice provided through the activity. The museums were of different sizes, locations, visitor number, and foci. A descriptive-interpretative approach was adopted, with data sources comprising observations, semistructured interviews with students, and museum worksheets. Analysis of the museum activities has yielded four levels of choice that affect learning from no choice to free choice activities. The effectiveness of learning was examined as well by looking at task behavior, linkage to the students' prior knowledge and their school's science curriculum, and linkage to the students' life and experience. Our findings indicate that activities of limited choice offered scaffolding, allowed the students to control their learning, and enhanced deeper engagement in the learning process. Within all the choice opportunities, the students connected the visit to their own life experiences and to their prior knowledge, even when the guided activity scarcely addressed it. Critical responses were obtained mainly when the museum environment allows a variety of learning opportunities without directing the students. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Bamberger, Y.; Department of Education in Technology and Science, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel; email: ybamberg@technion.ac.il",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

What is called teaching, therefore, involves not only the words and sentences a teacher utters and writes on the board during a lesson, but also all the hands/arms gestures, body movements, and facial expressions a teacher performs in the classroom. All of these communicative modalities constitute resources that are made available to students for making sense of and learning from lectures. Yet in the literature on teaching science, these other means of communication are little investigated and understood - and, corre-spondingly, they are undertheorized. The purpose of this position paper is to argue for a different view of concepts in lectures: they are performed simultaneously drawing on and producing multiple resources that are different expressions of the same holistic meaning unit. To support our point, we provide examples from a database of 26 lectures in a 12th-grade biology class, where the human body was the main topic of study. We analyze how different types of resources - including verbal and nonverbal discourse and various material artifacts - interact during lectures. We provide evidence for the unified production of these various sense-making resources during teaching to constitute a meaning unit, and we emphasize particularly the use of gestures and body orientations inside this meaning unit. We suggest that proper analyses of meaning units need to take into account not only language and diagrams but also a lecturer's pointing and depicting gestures, body positions, and the relationships between these different modalities. Scientific knowledge (conceptions) exists in the concurrent display of all sense-making resources, which we, following Vygotsky, understand as forming a unit (identity) of nonidentical entities. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Pozzer-Ardenghi, L.; Applied Cognitive Science, University of Victoria, P.O.

Analysis of the semistructured pre- and postinterviews reveals that students attend to the content domain, local activity, and their personal preferences when evaluating representations. Analysis of video case studies that followed the students as they created their representations further reveals several key mediators of the students' representational activities, including other students, task constraints, the teacher, and local norms for what constituted a ""good representation."" In addition, the data show that these norms shifted over time as new content was covered in the class, and were appropriated in interaction with other students.

We argue that there is a misalignment between the 3Rs of scientific practice and the practices common in classrooms, and that this misalignment poses a considerable obstacle for beginning teachers who attempt to implement reform pedagogy. As part of a secondary methods course, 16 preservice teachers (PSTs) participated in two exemplar activities designed to engage them in scientific practices. The PST performances suggest that at least initially, they did not consider authentic scientific practices appropriate for classroom activities, implying a pedagogical repertoire dominated by the 3Rs of traditional classrooms. PST performances, however, evidenced a shift in the 3Rs from those common in classrooms to those required by these activities, suggesting that their visions for classrooms are malleable and underlining the importance of aligning the 3Rs of scientific and classroom practices during teacher preparation. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Ford, M.J.; Department of Instruction and Learning, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, United States; email: mjford@pitt.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

Learners have a limited working memory, and instructional representations should be designed with the goal of reducing unnecessary cognitive load. However, cognitive architecture alone is not the only factor to be considered; individual differences, especially prior knowledge, are critical in determining what impact a visual representation will have on learners' cognitive structures and processes. Prior knowledge can determine the ease with which learners can perceive and interpret visual representations in working memory.

Much of their learning occurs informally, simply by participating in the everyday, ongoing collective life of the chosen group. Such settings provide unique opportunities for studying how people learn science in complex settings without being directly instructed. This study was designed to investigate learning and teaching that occurs through ordinary, everyday participation in environmental action. We draw on data collected during a 2-year ethnographic study of a coast-wide eelgrass-mapping project. Taking a whole activity as our unit of analysis, we articulate the forms of participation that volunteers take and theorize learning in terms of changing participation and expanding opportunities for action. The community-based eelgrass stewardship group we studied is both socially and materially heterogeneous, made up of people young and old and with different expertise. We show that changing forms of participation are emergent features of unfolding sociomaterial inter-action, not determinate roles or rules. Furthermore, the possibilities for learning expand when individuals have the opportunity to frame problems that arise in ongoing activity. In the setting of our study, attributions (dichotomies) such as ""off-task/on-task"" and ""teacher/learner"" are artificial. We suggest that by providing expanding opportunities, in the form of a variety of sociomaterial resources. science educators can rethink the design of school-based science learning environments. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Boyer, L.; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, University of Victoria, PO Box 3010, Victoria, BC V8W 3N4, Canada; email: leanna@uvic.ca",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

The model includes a common science curriculum based on NSF-supported materials commercially available, ongoing teacher professional development built around day-to-day lessons, and regular in-class support of teachers by expert peer coaches. One cohort of students at three Philadelphia middle schools using the model was followed from the end of fourth grade through seventh grade. Their gains in science achievement and achievement levels were substantially greater than students at 3 matched control schools and the 23 district middle schools serving a similar student population.

More specifically, this mixed-methods study investigates how learners apply genetics content knowledge as they justify claims relative to genetic engineering. Interviews are conducted with 45 participants, representing three distinct groups: high school students with variable genetics knowledge, college nonscience majors with little genetics knowledge, and college science majors with advanced genetics knowledge. During the interviews, participants advance positions concerning three scenarios dealing with gene therapy and cloning. Arguments are assessed in terms of the number of justifications offered as well as justification quality, based on a five-point rubric. Multivariate analysis of variance results indicate that college science majors outperformed the other groups in terms of justification quality and frequency. Argumentation does not differ among nonscience majors or high school students. Follow-up qualitative analyses of interview responses suggest that all three groups tend to focus on similar, sociomoral themes as they negotiate socially complex, genetic engineering issues, but that the science majors frequently reference specific science content knowledge in the justification of their claims. Results support the Threshold Model of Content Knowledge Transfer, which proposes two knowledge thresholds around which argumentation quality can reasonably be expected to increase.

However, the inability of students to have a multimodal understanding of the concepts is seen as restricting their understandings of the concepts. The aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of using writing-to-learn strategies that required students to embed multimodal representations of the concepts. In particular, the study compared a presentation format with a summary report format for students learning quantum theory. A pre-post test design was used to compare performances of these two groups across two units. For unit 1, students' scores from groups that completed either a presentation format (PowerPoint presentation) or a summary report format (chapter summary) were compared. No limits were placed on the amount of text or the number of representations used. For unit 2, products of both groups were constructed for an audience of year 10 students. The presentation format group (PowerPoint) was limited to 15 slides, with a maximum of 10 words displayed per slide; a script was written to accompany the presentation. Slides could include graphical and mathematical formulae; however, the text could not. The summary report format group that wrote out its explanations was limited to four pages and was required to incorporate multimodal representations. Results indicated that for both units students using the presentation format group scored significantly better on tests than the summary report format group. The effect size difference between the groups increased for the second unit, indicating that more practice was leading to better student understanding of the physics concepts. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Gunel, M.; Science Education Department, Education Faculty of Kazim Karabekir, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey; email: mgunel@iastate.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

The results are demonstrable; as a result of the strong emphasis on micro processes in evolution education, students and teachers still have poor understanding of the processes which operate at the macro level, and virtually no understanding at all of the history of life on our planet. Natural selection has become synonymous with the suite of processes we call evolution. This paper makes the case for a paradigm shift in evolution education, so that both perspectives - micro and macro - are given equal weight. Increasingly, issues of bioethics, human origins, cloning, etc., are being cast in a light that requires an understanding of macroevolution. To deny our students access to this debate is to deny the call for universal science literacy. A methodology from professional practice is proposed that could achieve this goal, and discussed in light of its utility, theoretical underpinnings, and historical legacy.

R3B 2E9, Canada","Contemporary assessment practices in science education have undergone significant changes in recent decades, The basis for these changes and the resulting new assessment practices are the subject of this two-part paper. Part 1 considers the basis of assessment that, more than 25 years ago, was driven by the assumptions of decomposability and decontextualization of knowledge, resulting in a low-inference testing system, often described as ""traditional."" This assessment model was replaced not on account of direct criticism, but rather on account of a larger revolution-the change from behavioral to cognitive psychology, developments in the philosophy of science, and the rise of constructivism. Most notably, the study of the active cognitive processes of the individual resulted in a major emphasis on context in learning and assessment. These changes gave rise to the development of various contextual assessment methodologies in science education, for example, concept mapping assessment, performance assessment, and portfolio assessment. In Part 2, the literature relating to the assessment methods identified in Part 1 is reviewed, revealing that there is not much research that supports their validity and reliability. However, encouraging new work on selected-response tests is forming the basis for reconsideration of past criticisms of this technique. Despite the major developments in contextual assessment methodologies in science education, two important questions remain unanswered, namely, whether grades can be considered as genuine numeric quantities and whether the individual student is the appropriate unit of assessment in public accountability.

We examined the NOS views of nine UTAs, and the impact of job-embedded professional development on their views.

Data included participants' responses to open-ended and Likert scale surveys, interviews, writing prompts, and participant observations of classroom sessions. We propose a model of the interaction of the prominent components of teachers' conceptual ecologies for NOS, one in which learning dispositions, understandings of the broad enterprise of science, and orientation to learning and learners are understood to shape teachers' conceptual frameworks for NOS. The complex ties between NOS conceptions and goals, affect, dispositions, and beliefs speak to the inclusion of the bounded nature of science as a central aspect of NOS for practicing teachers. Teachers' dispositions toward learning this construct are linked to their conceptions of the boundaries of science as well as their understanding of the role of NOS in their own teaching. We argue that a recognition of the bounded nature of science foregrounds actions of a teacher's learning disposition, thus potentially minimizing the influence of their religious beliefs. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Southerland, S.A.; Department of Middle and Secondary Education, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL 32106-4490, United States; email: southerl@coe.fsu.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

More specifically, we argue the point that such shifts between communicative approaches are an inevitable part of teaching whose purpose is to support meaningful learning of scientific knowledge. We suggest that a necessary tension therefore exists between authoritative and dialogic approaches as dialogic exchanges are followed by authoritative interventions (to develop the canonical scientific view), and the authoritative introduction of new ideas is followed by the opportunity for dialogic application and exploration of those ideas. In these ways, one communicative approach follows from the other, authoritativeness acting as a seed for dialogicity and vice versa. We discuss how this analysis, in terms of shifts in communicative approach, offers a new and complementary perspective on supporting ""productive disciplinary engagement"" (Engle & Conant, 2002, Cognition and Instruction, 20, 399-484) in the classroom.

Specifically, we were interested in learning more about eco-justice issues that are related to environmental degradation in Malawi and the potential role of inquiry-oriented pedagogies in addressing these issues. In a science methods course, the African educators' views on deforestation and teaching about ecological sustainability were explored within the context of the local environment and culture. Teachers participated in inquiry pedagogies designed to promote the sharing of perspectives related to the connections between culture and ecological degradation. Strategies encouraging dialogue and reflection included role-playing, class discussions, curriculum development activities, teaching experiences with children, and field trips to a nature preserve. Data were analyzed from postcolonial and critical pedagogy of place theoretical perspectives to better understand the hybridization of viewpoints influenced by both Western and indigenous science and the political hegemonies that impact sustainable living in Malawi.

This methodology embraces an item-scaling psychometrics based on the judgments by a panel of experts, a multiple response model, a scoring system, and the data analysis. The methodology finally produces normalized attitudinal indices that represent the respondent's reasoned beliefs toward STS statements, the respondent's position on an item that comprises several statements, or the respondent's position on an entire STS topic that encompasses a set of items.

This includes critical assessment of scientific claims and arguments involved. In this study we asked 89 science education students with substantial academic qualifications in science, working in groups of two and three, to assess the reliability of scientific claims in an article of their own choice, but related to a socioscientific issue, and to present their evaluation in a short text. In analyzing the students' texts, we focused on the criteria they had explicitly and implicitly used in their evaluations. Through a qualitative analysis, we identified 13 different criteria focusing on empirical and theoretical adequacy, completeness of presented information, social aspects, and manipulative strategies. An inspection of the students' evaluations revealed that they drew upon knowledge of possible institutional interests, different signs of competence and an appreciation of concurrent expert views, but also methodological norms in science, specialized content knowledge, and an appreciation of evidence and disclosure of sources.

The hierarchy model maintains the flow of information and knowledge from universities to teachers to students. In science education, the hierarchy model may be strengthened by science's own history of hierarchy. This study describes the authors' attempt to contest the hierarchy model by facilitating a collaborative planning project with elementary teachers. Critical discourse analysis is used as the primary theoretical and methodological tool to (1) explain how the hierarchy model was shaped by and shaped the group's actions, interactions, and identities; (2) explain the complexities of collaboration by moving beyond deficit-based explanations (e.g., blaming individuals or organizational structures); (3) offer theoretical and methodological approaches for understanding better the nature of collaboration and practical solutions for those attempting to challenge the history of hierarchy.

Our case study investigates teacher responses to the challenges of constructivist environments, since teachers can play strong roles in supporting or undermining even the best constructivist environments or materials. We were invited to work as mediators with a middle-school science staff that was experiencing conflicts regarding two learning environments, PBL (which was the school's ""politically correct"" learning environment) and traditional. With mediated group workshops, teachers were sensitized to their own and colleagues' individual learning differences (ILDs), as measured by two styles inventories (the LSI - Kolb, 1976; and the LCI - Johnston & Dainton, 1997). Using these inventories, a learning-environment questionnaire, field notes, and delayed interviews a year later, we found that there was a relationship between teachers' preferred styles, epistemological beliefs, and their preferred teaching environment. Moreover, when the participating teachers, including early-adopters and nonvolunteers to PBL, became more sensitive to their colleagues' preferences, many staff conflicts were resolved and some mismatched teachers expressed more openness to PBL. We argue that having teachers understand their own ILDs and related responses to constructivist learning environments can contribute to resolving staff conflicts and sustaining such environments.

For various possible reasons, however, students tend not to be engaged in such inquiries. Among factors that may limit their opportunities to engage in open-ended inquiries of their design are teachers' conceptions about science. To explore possible relationships between teachers' conceptions about science and the types of inquiry activities in which they engage students, instrumental case studies of five secondary science teachers were developed, using field notes, repertory grids, samples of lesson plans and student activities, and semistructured interviews. Based on constructivist grounded theory analysis, participating teachers' tendencies to promote student-directed, open-ended scientific inquiry projects seemed to correspond with positions about the nature of science to which they indicated adherence. A tendency to encourage and enable students to carry out student-directed, open-ended scientific inquiry projects appeared to be associated with adherence to social constructivist views about science. Teachers who opposed social constructivist views tended to prefer tight control of student knowledge building procedures and conclusions. We suggest that these results can be explained with reference to human psychological factors, including those associated with teachers' self-esteem and their relationships with knowledge-building processes in the discipline of their teaching. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Bencze, J.L.; Department of Curriculum, Teaching, and Learning, OISE, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.

Are there discipline-specific values and heuristics that guide chemistry research? How does research experience influence participants' epistemic beliefs? We found that participants' epistemic beliefs varied significantly with chemistry expertise and with exposure to authentic research in chemistry. Differences in both the duration and the nature of participation in research had a significant effect on how participants conceptualized science and scientific research. We noted that only the practicing scientists saw a productive role for empirical anomalies that arise in the course of doing research.

However, in the United States, standards-based reform has focused the national discussion on documenting students' attainment of high educational standards. Students' science achievement is one of those standards, and in many states, ""high- stakes"" tests determine the resultant achievement measures. Policymakers and administrators use those tests to rank school performance, to prevent students' graduation, and to evaluate teachers. With science test measures used in different ways, statistical confidence in the measures' validity and reliability is essential. Using a science achievement test from one state's systemic reform project as an example, this paper discusses the strengths of the Rasch model as a psychometric tool and analysis technique, referring to person item maps, anchoring, differential item functioning, and person item fit. Furthermore, the paper proposes that science educators should carefully inspect the tools they use to measure and document changes in educational systems. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Boone, W.J.; School of Education and Allied Professions, Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, United States; email: boonewj@muohio.edu",,,00368326,,,,"English","Sci.

What criteria do they use when they critique these materials in preparation for adapting them, when they develop the criteria themselves and when they are given a set of criteria from which to choose? These results indicate that the 20 participating preservice elementary teachers held a sophisticated set of criteria for critiquing instructional materials; for example, they paid attention to scientific inquiry and instructional goals. In some cases, providing options from which they could select as a part of the instructional approach taken in the class allowed the preservice teachers to engage in substantive critique of the instructional materials along criteria not prominent in their initial set. Even with explicit support, however, the preservice teachers did not engage in substantive critique about how scientific content is represented. Furthermore, they typically describe inquiry as important to incorporate to promote student interest, not to engage students in genuine scientific activity. It is concluded that critique activities used in science methods courses should be authentic and scaffolded to be optimally effective.

However, previous research suggests that students do not easily understand phenomena from a particle perspective, although such a perspective has many concrete aspects that ought to assist learners of chemistry. More than the textbooks of other countries, Korean chemistry texts tend to include colorful inscriptions. How, we might ask, do such inscriptions help learners of chemistry? The purpose of this study is to investigate the function and structure of chemical inscriptions in middle school science textbooks by drawing on a semiotic framework. We develop the concept of ""chemi (stry)-semiotics"" to unveil the work of reading required to understand chemical inscriptions in the way their authors intended them to be understood. The study began with the assumption that different kinds and functions (structure) of inscriptions constitute different ""signs"" that are available as sense-making resources in the learning process.

Forty-five third-grade girls, 29 of their families, and three of their teachers were interviewed to ascertain girls' preferences among various book genres, as well as to learn the ways in which families and teachers influence the choices girls make. We found that girls had access to science books at school, and teachers had strategies to encourage reading them. At home, parents encouraged reading, but were generally less directive than teachers as to what the girls read, and underestimated their daughters' science-related interests. The families studied rely largely on major bookstores as their primary source of books.

In this paper, we examine the ways two middle school teachers talk about their identity and teaching practices and coordinate these self-reports with our own observations of how they implement a new environmental science curriculum. More specifically, we compare the teachers' beliefs about learning, goals for the classroom community and for instruction, and their knowledge of science content, and pedagogy. Furthermore, we discuss teaching dilemmas, which arise for these teachers as their identities and practices intersect and at times conflict. We argue, however, that a focus on practice and outcomes is an important, but limited aspect of what we, as a field, need to consider when attempting to understand the complexities of teaching and learning. Therefore, we continue to expand our understanding of two science classrooms as we examine the teachers' multiple identities in relation to their implementation of a science curriculum.

Following intervention, progression was evident in many different forms and this could be described and measured both qualitatively and quantitatively. The routes and pathways toward scientific conceptualization were often direct, and most changes could be attributed largely to the processes of weak and radical knowledge restructuring.

The findings showed that several students initially experienced difficulties in identifying a problem themselves but after discussing with family and friends, were able to overcome this initial barrier and subsequently formulated personally meaningful problems for investigation. The ill-structured problems stimulated students to pose questions which charted their courses of action, leading to independent inquiry. Students were led to investigate multidisciplinary elements beyond the boundaries of typical school science, and also learned about different modes of inquiry. The issues and challenges identified included identifying a problem for investigation; asking questions to negotiate the learning pathway; deciding what areas to pursue, given a multitude of possibilities; and figuring out how to extract relevant information from the available mass.

Several classifications have been proposed to analyze students' conceptions about matter and its changes. Starting from Anderson's categorization, this research studied students' understanding of the qualitative conservation of matter (substance), and how this understanding is influenced by previous instruction in chemistry and task variables. Here, task variables include chemical content and problem context. Four groups of adolescents that differed in age (from 12 to 17 years) and scientific instruction, and two groups of university students with different expertise in chemistry were presented with a 22‐item paper‐and‐pencil test about the conservation of matter. The items involved physical changes (solutions or changes of state) and chemical changes (reactions), and were posed both in academic chemistry contexts and everyday situations. Results show the influence of group membership, task content, and problem context on students' performance. Test scores increased with age and instruction in chemistry, but the influence of chemical expertise was smaller than that predicted from research in other scientific areas. Concerning context, for everyday situations reactions are the most difficult content; on the other hand, in academic chemistry the most difficult content was solutions. Analyses for category answers showed that subjects are likely to concentrate their interpretations in two main categories, interaction (substances interact to form new ones) and modification with identity (substances modified in appearance continue to be the same). However, conceptions depend also significantly on content and context task. Finally, we have found that science instruction increases the consistency of the conceptions held by subjects. Younger subjects and adolescents without scientific instruction tended to be less consistent than more expert subjects. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In the Model–based Analysis and Reasoning in Science (MARS) project, an attempt is made to create an environment conducive to fostering conceptual understanding and reasoning about scientific phenomena that involve “balance of forces.” Visual models that are dynamic and interactive are presented not only to concretize abstract ideas but also as reasoning tools that give students the leverage to solve problems in a variety of contexts. This model–centered curriculum focuses on a network of concepts important for understanding hydrostatics; that is, floating and sinking, as an exemplar for the general principle of balance of forces. How students understand these concepts and use models as a disciplinary resource to engage in chains of reasoning that integrate concepts into networks of relations is of special interest for study. How students use that understanding in new situations within the same explanatory system is also being studied. A major pedagogical question is how middle–school students can be taught to engage in model–based reasoning, a form of reasoning that scientists routinely use. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons. Inc.

Conceptual change for students and teachers is viewed not just as a process of replacement of old concepts but also as a process of learning to relate ideas to appropriate contexts. The process of instruction and collaboration was influenced by institutional limits on time, the press to cover the curriculum, and the teacher's prior beliefs and practices. The study uses “phenomenography” to conceptualize students' understandings of solubility. Six categories of description were constructed: (a) physical transformation from solid to liquid; (b) chemical transformation of solute; (c) density of solute; (d) amount of space available in solution; (e) properties of solute; and (f) size of solute. After instruction students showed evidence of two additional ways of talking about solubility: (a) chemical structure of components; and (b) solution equilibrium. The new language, however, did not necessarily replace initial ideas about what happens in particular instances of solution chemistry. A careful analysis of the students' conceptions of solubility revealed important factors influencing the nature of student learning in this area of chemistry. These factors include: (a) ambiguities of chemical theories about dissolving: (b) explanations of the observable; and (c) students' chemical language. It is argued, in conclusion, that the goals for instruction are to assist students to appreciate contexts where everyday conceptions of chemical phenomenon are appropriate and contexts where particular conceptions from the community of chemists are more appropriate. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons.

Proposed solutions are mainly inspired by a constructivist cognitive science perspective and are formulated as general teaching strategies that aim at a more or less forced process of “conceptual change.” However, in our view, “developmental research” is needed in which small–scale curriculum development is cyclically coupled to indepth classroom research of teaching–learning processes. Such research should resuit in worked out examples of successful ways of teaching, according to new conceptual curriculum structures. Designing such “didactical” structures constitutes a longer term research program, which asks for international exchange and cooperation. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This scale was subsequently validated and administered to a sample of grade 9 and 10 students (N = 172) of average achievement and ability, at a predominantly middle–class suburban high school in New York State.

This way to solve problems is often introduced to college students in the units on chemical equilibrium: for instance, the concentration of a substance at equilibrium is first approximated in order to facilitate the calculation of the other concentrations. Along with its technical benefit, the introduction of this procedure can also help students to achieve a more thoughtful conception of the scientific method. Yet learning to use heuristic hypotheses is technically difficult because the procedure is logically complex and strongly appeals to field‐related knowledge. In addition, learning this procedure also involves conceptual difficulties which hamper the students' focus on the technical obstacles. Indeed this strategy is sometimes difficult for novices to grasp and even to recognize as a legitimate scientific procedure because it seems to be based on different principles than the classical procedure of problem solving: it relies on an empirical conception of accuracy, it does not separate the steps of modeling and calculations and its reasoning is based on premises that can only be demonstrated once the problem has been solved. When heuristic hypotheses are superficially introduced to beginners and are presented as bare simplifications. One can observe a misunderstanding and misuse of the procedure which reveal in fact more general misconceptions.

A conceptual development model is described to guide the connection between theory and evidence on a level appropriate for children, from early years to senior years. For the senior years it is also important to connect the activity of teaching to a sound theoretical structure. The theoretical structure must illuminate the status of theory in science, establish what counts as evidence, clarify the relationship between experiment and explanation, and make connections to the history of science.

Data were gathered using participant observations in a high school Biology II classroom as well as a series of 17 open‐ended and structured interviews with each of four research participants. The interviews were designed to illustrate the participants' approaches to biology as well as to describe their changing conceptual frameworks for evolutionary theory. Interview techniques used include: concept mapping, drawing interviews, discussion of pre‐ and posttests, and sorting tasks. A learner's conceptual ecology for evolution was found to include prior conceptions related to evolutionary theory (both scientific and alternative), scientific and religious orientations, view of the biological world, and acceptance of evolutionary theory. However, the data demonstrate that the actions of these aspects of the conceptual ecology can vary among individuals and no single controlling mechanism was isolated.

The purpose of this study was to investigate scientific reasoning skills used by students in a naturalistic collaborative writing context and changes in students' reasoning discourse over time. During the fall and winter of 1992‐1993, three ninth grade general science classes taught by one teacher participated in a collaborative writing intervention. The students wrote ten collaborative laboratory reports over the course of the intervention. Report guidelines were designed by the teacher and the researcher to assist students with their writing. An interpretive research design was used to study the conversations of three target student pairs in depth. Eleven distinct, yet integrated scientific reasoning skills used to support report composition emerged from the data. The emergent scientific reasoning skills reflected the socially constructed nature of reasoning for collaborative writing. Patterns in the data revealed that all target students used reasoning skills in similar ways to: (a) assess prior models of scientific phenomena; (b) generate new models for scientific phenomena; (c) extend models to new situations; and (d) support other forms of reasoning. One of the target pairs improved their reasoning discourse over time by discussing conceptual meanings more fully and bringing specific information into their conversations. The other two target pairs did not change their reasoning discourse systematically throughout the intervention. The findings of this study suggest that an understanding of socially constructed scientific reasoning skills is important for designing meaningful collaborative activities and assessments in science. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Aside from the fact that the literature is very sparse in this area about what obtains in developing countries, nothing appears to be available with regard to how wait‐time interacts with the sociocultural factors within non‐Western science classrooms. In a non‐Western country such as Nigeria where most science programs in schools are inquiry‐oriented, do teachers take notice of, and effectively use, wait‐time in the teaching‐learning process? Are science teachers able to effectively use the mediating role of sociocultural factors in science teaching in a traditional environment which expects children to be seen only and not heard? The main purpose of this study was to investigate the wait‐time of Nigerian integrated science teachers in relation to the amount of students' participation in inquiry. This study also investigated the relationship between wait‐time and sociocultural attitudinal factors prevalent in traditional societies. The instruments used for data collection were the Hough's Observational Schedule and a modified version of the Socio‐Cultural Environment Scale (SCES); a stop‐watch was used to measure the wait‐time of audio‐recorded integrated science lessons of 37 integrated science teachers from selected junior secondary schools in Kaduna State, Nigeria. The results showed that the average wait‐time TT and wait‐time ST of the integrated science teachers was 3.0 seconds and 0.7 seconds, respectively. The study reported the amount of student participation in the student‐teacher classroom discourse to be very low. Wait‐time was also shown to have a strong relationship with sociocultural factors of authoritarianism, goal structure, societal expectation, and traditional worldview. The pedagogical and curricular implications of the results have been highlighted. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

As a result there is a serious deficiency in public understanding of the planet on which we all live. This lack includes national and international leaders in politics, business, and science. The earth system science effort now engaging the research talent of the earth sciences provides a firm foundation from the sciences for inclusion of earth systems content into the evolving integrated science curricula of this country and others. Implementing integrated science curricula, especially at the secondary level where potential leaders often have their only exposure to science, can help to address these problems. The earth system provides a conceptual theme as opposed to a disciplinary theme for organizing such integrated curricula, absent from prior efforts. The end of the cold war era is resulting in a reexamination of science and the influence it has had on our planet and society. In the future, science and the curricula that teach about science must seriously address the environmental and social problems left in the wake of over 100 years of preparation for military and economic war. The earth systems education effort provides one such approach to the modernization of science curricula. Earth science educators should assume leadership in helping to establish such curricula in this country and around the world. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons. Inc.

Results obtained show the considerable difference in student performance on chemistry problems (mol, gases, solutions, and photoelectric effect) that require algorithmic or conceptual understanding. The difference between student performance on algorithmic and conceptual problems can be interpreted as a process of progressive transitions (models) that facilitate different degrees of explanatory power to student conceptual understanding. A parallel is drawn between the methodology of idealization (simplifying assumptions) used by scientists and the construction of strategies (models) used by students to facilitate conceptual understanding. A major educational implication of this study is that the relationship between algorithmic and conceptual problems is not dichotomous, but rather characterized by a continuum that consists of sequences of models that facilitate greater conceptual understanding. This reconstruction of student strategies to solve problems (progressive transitions) can provide the teacher a framework to anticipate as to how student understanding could develop from being entirely algorithmic to conceptual. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This article proposes that this goal be abandoned as impossible to attain, and be replaced by a goal of intellectual communalism between scientists and nonscientists. The argument draws upon work demonstrating that epistemic dependence of nonexperts upon experts and of experts upon each other is an unavoidable characteristic of knowledge acquisition. This dependence implies both the need for trust in expertise and for expertise to be used responsibly. Faced with epistemic dependence, the alternative of intellectual communalism for science is recunimended in which nonscientists defer to scientists on matters of evidence for scientific knowledge claims, but use the combined judgment of scientists critically to assess alleged scientific expertise. It is claimed that scientists have no special experrise in the use of scientific knowledge, and that nonscientists must play an evaluative role in this regard. The sort of instruction proposed to achieve the goal of intellectual communalism consists of standard instruction in scientific knowledge, metascientific discussion about the nature of scientific knowledge and expertise, and instruction and practice in judging expertise. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The educational impact is often reported in terms of the exhibit's attracting power (number of visitors who stop at the exhibit) and holding power (amount of time spent by visitors at the exhibit). Occasionally, the visitor's engagement level (degree to which the visitor pays attention to the exhibit) is also used as an assessment of the exhibit's educational impact. In this study, 154 visitors to a science museum discovery space were observed as they interacted freely with the exhibits. The exhibits were categorized into five different styles based upon three criteria: (1) high or low interaction; (2) concrete or abstract presentation; and (3) simple or complex information presented. Data indicated significant differences between exhibit style and attraction, holding power, and visitor engagement levels. Attraction levels were highest for exhibits with concrete presentations. Holding power was highest for exhibits with high interaction and concrete presentations. Engagement levels were highest for high interaction exhibits.

The qualitative study was guided by constructivist theory and utilized two small groups of four children each. Each child was interviewed prior to and after, as well as observed throughout, the instructional unit on simple electric circuits. The interviews centered around three different electric circuit tasks: predictions and explanations of eight electric circuit problems: the completion and explanation of three electric circuit drawings; and the identification of an electric current diagram, which was based on Osborne's (1983) work. The findings for these children suggested that: (1) the nature of children's understandings of electric circuits is dependent upon the interplay between their understandings of circuit connections and understandings of electric current; (2) prior to instruction children's understandings of electric circuits were scientifically inaccurate and tended to emphasize understandings of circuit connections; (3) children held multiple understandings of electric current prior to instruction, whereas following instruction most children held a single understanding of electric current, albeit scientifically inaccurate; and (4) after instruction children demonstrated a more accurate technical understanding of electric circuits, but only one child demonstrated a scientific understanding of electric current. Based on these findings, conclusions about knowledge restructuring are presented, as well as implications for teaching, assessment, and research. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Second, the construct of conceptual change has been defined in many ways with more preeminence given to radical conceptual change. I point out that weak or normal conceptual change is worthy of equal attention from science educators. Third, conceptualizing conceptual change in terms of gradations on a continuum enables teachers and researchers to achieve a clearer understanding of the way in which analogies contribute to conceptual change. Fourth, in order to give analogies a fair evaluation, the conceptual change paradigm ought to endorse a broader conception of change which conjoins propositional and procedural knowledge and accounts for the affective and creative processes that are associated with the education of the whole person and not only the learning of specific concepts. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

When the students did not know the correct common name for a plant (e.g., oak, dandelion), they relied on a variety of response strategies to deal with their lack of knowledge. Three patterns of response emerged when students lacked knowledge of names for plants. Student responses may represent avoidance strategies: avoidance of admission of ignorance, avoidance of being wrong, or avoidance of giving a name more abstract than the common name (e.g., tree, wildflower). These strategies did not result in names that would be acceptable to a science teacher, but the strategies had the effect of hiding the students' lack of knowledge or preventing a “wrong” answer. The study demonstrated that students prefer to identify plants at the generic level (e.g., calling a plant oak rather than tree), which suggests that elementary students should be introduced to the concept of genus (e.g., oak, lily) before being introduced to the more abstract levels of the botanical classification scheme (e.g., class monocot, dicot). © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In this article, the author will describe the research which challenges the validity of using multiple‐choice instruments to assess graphing abilities. The evidence from this research will identify numerous disparities between the results of multiple‐choice and free‐response instruments. In the first study, 72 subjects in the seventh, ninth, and eleventh grades were administered individual clinical interviews to assess their ability to construct and interpret graphs. A wide variety of graphs and situations were assessed. In three instances during the interview, students drew a graph that would best represent a situation and then explained their drawings. The results of these clinical graphing interviews were very different from similar questions assessed through multiple‐choice formats in other research studies. In addition, insights into students' thinking about graphing reveal that some multiple‐choice graphing questions from prior research studies and standardized tests do not discriminate between right answers/right reasons, right answers/wrong reasons, and answers scored “wrong” but correct for valid reasons. These results indicate that in some instances multiple‐choice questions are not a valid measure of graphing abilities. In a second study, the researcher continued to pursue the questions raised about the validity of multiple‐choice tests to assess graphing, researching the following questions: What can be learned about subjects' graphing abilities when students draw their own graphs compared to assessing by means of a multiple‐choice instrument? Does the methodology used to assess graphing abilities: (1) affect the percentage of subjects who answer correctly; (2) alter the percentage of subjects affected by the “picture of the event” phenomenon? Instruments were constructed consisting of three graphing questions that asked students: (a) multiple‐choice‐choose a graph that best represents the situation; (b) free‐response‐draw a graph that best represents the situation. The sample of 1416 subjects from an urbadsuburban area in cluded 50% boys/50% girls from grades 8 through 12; subjects from high, medium, and low ability groups; and subjects from both public and private schools. The subjects completed either the multiple‐choice or the free draw instrument. The free draw instrument was scored by comparing the subject's response to categories of possible answers that had been identified from the first study. The results show as much as 19% difference in correct responses, three times as many “picture of the events” from multiple‐choice instruments, and significant differences in how multiple‐choice and free‐response affect various ability levels and grade levels. As such, some of the research studies that used multiple‐choice instruments to examine giaphing and the impact of MBL on student's graphing abilities may be invalid. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons. Inc.

When two people communicate, what passes between them are the words and gestures they use to attempt to convey meaning, not the meaning itself. So a teacher has some ideas which he or she hopes to convey by putting them into words, diagrams or symbols. The child may take note of the words, and so on, but from these has to build up a meaning for them. There is clearly a strong possibility that this meaning created by the child is not the meaning intended by the teacher. This possibility is very high if the type of language used by the teacher, or workcard, or textbook writer, is not familiar to the child. Then various things may happen, as Barnes (1986) has so clearly pointed out: a) The child may ignore what the teacher is saying. b) The teacher may ignore what the pupil is saying (the teacher “controls” knowledge by using unfamiliar language, consequently children'S ideas are devalued and are only heard when they talk among themselves). c) The teacher may insist that the pupils use the “correct” words and so, sound scientific. (We, like Barnes, have seen children praised for “thinking like a scientist” when it is clear that the children are simply “making noises which sound scientific”).

While young children tend not to be big energy users, they can be taught to view energy in a different way from the way their parents view it. This can be accomplished by elementary teachers in much the same way that they try to teach good health habits or the practice of looking both ways before crossing the street. Perhaps the elementary school is also the place to begin introducing the idea that energy conservation does not necessarily mean doing with less, but using energy more wisely. Teachers serve as a vital link between what society thinks is important and what is taught to elementary age children. This is especially true when considering that the attitudes that teachers possess can be easily passed on to their students (Hone & Carswell, 1969) and thus reflected in their future behavior (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980). It is desirable, therefore, that an ethical procedure be identified that enhances the probability of teachers including energy conservation topics in the elementary school curriculum. The persuasive communication model of attitude change has been demonstrated to function as such an ethical procedure within the context of science education (Grabowski, Shrigley, & Welliver, 1980; Koballa & Shrigley, 1983).

Piagetian theory emphasizes the importance of interactive experiences and exposure to materials as opposed to direct instruction. In this study, interactive free choice learning experiences are compared to and combined with the lecture‐demonstration approach. The goal of both forms of instruction was to teach children to criticize and control experiments. The lecture‐demonstration approach without opportunities for free choice was superior to free choice alone or free choice combined with the lecture‐demonstration approach in teaching students to criticize experiments. Lecture‐demonstration followed by free choice was superior to free choice followed by lecture‐demonstration, and to free choice combined with lecture‐demonstration in teaching students to design controlled experiments. Results suggest that the ability to criticize experiments is a necessary condition for acquiring the ability to design controlled experiments. Contrary to some of Piaget's statements and to recent research (Kuhn & Angelev, 1976), this study suggests that instruction combined with exposure to materials is more effective than exposure alone in fostering an ability to criticize and control experiments. Results suggest that free choice is an effective instructional tool only after students have some familiarity with the goals of instruction. That is, students who are able to criticize experiments can learn to design controlled experiments from a free‐choice program.

Rather than a one‐shot move into what passes for a full PBTE format, a gradual phasing‐in operation concurrent with suitable research seems desirable. Without the research information, PBTE may become another bandwagon passing across the educational scene without making any discernible change in teacher education. Some consistent view of the overall educational enterprise and of the teaching act, relating these to PBTE, is an absolute necessity. The PBTE move provides a useful research vehicle regardless of any verdict reached on its efficacy as a teacher education format. Current funding of educational research on a scale appropriate to the kinds of questions needing study appears limited. This suggests that a viable approach to researching both those vital questions connecting what teachers do and acceptable goals for pupils and PBTE as a vehicle must employ existing program components such as microteaching. This also suggests similar research designs be employed in many places if the summation of results is to provide useful information.

The result indicated greater achievement of two of the objectives by students enrolled in divergent laboratories than by students enrolled in traditional laboratories. Additionally, the need for revising some elements of the divergent laboratory was indicated, as well as a need for special training of the graduate assistants who conducted the divergent laboratories.

Evidence from trend surveys suggest that the actual beneficiaries of the “flight from science” and engineering were the professional and managerial fields. Consideration is given to an alternative hypothesis that increasing economic opportunities outside science was one cause. This hypothesis assumes that many economically motivated students have chosen science because they lacked better economic opportunities outside science. Support for this assumption is found in an analysis of survey data on college men in the class of 1961 (N=21687).
